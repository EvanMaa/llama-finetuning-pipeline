{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskProgramming. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "This may sound a bit stupid but what exactly is sql?\n\nOkay let me clarify myself. I am a programmer. I worked with several languages such as c++, c#, java, python etc. In college we started learning sql. But I don't understand why there is so many of them(for example mysql, oracle sql, microsoft sql etc.). In normal programming languages we need the language itself downloaded like c++ for example, then we need a compiler/ide like gnu/gcc, theen finally we need a software, a text editor like notepad. First I thought mysql or ms sql is a compiler. But they're not. Then are they like different languages? If they are then why don't we call them languages instead we call them dbms? Anyway long story short I don't understand what is sql and what are those \"versions\" of it. If someone knows, please explain. Thank you!", "assistant": "Honestly I think you have the understanding of it, it just might be presented/used a little differently than other programming languages you are familiar with.\n\n\nSimply put, SQL is a query language for interacting with databases (Structured Query Language). It is designed to only interact with the data, and doesn't provide the full list of features we would expect in a \"general\" programming language. It is often \"embedded\" into other languages (ie, python, etc just like you mentioned) to allow them to interact with those databases.\n\nIt might be more useful to think of it as a very specialized language, which is often embedded into other languages to interact with databases.\n\n\nmysql, mssql, oracle sql, ect are all different databases (or \"database management systems\") that, more or less, implement the SQL standard and allow you to interact with them (although I am not sure how many of them are 100% compliant, and some add their own extensions).\n\n\nSQL by itself is typically used with other programming languages, although through a console you can often use SQL directly to interact with tables. The benefit is, that if you know how to use SQL in C# and you know how to use java (but have never used SQL in java), then you are like 98% of the way to using SQL in java. All you need to do is learn exactly how you \"embed\" the SQL in your java code, and maybe install a dependency.\n\n\nFor example, you mentioned c++.  There is a c++ standard just like SQL, and different compilers implement that standard (often along with their own extensions) to slightly different degrees."}

My experience is that no company wants to refactor working code as a preventative measure.", "assistant": "Had to look these up:\n\nThe SDP is \"component X should only rely on components more stable than Y\".\n\nThe I metric is \"ratio of outgoing dependencies (this component depends on another component) to outgoing+incoming dependencies\". The lower the ratio, the more stable the component is, or should be.\n\nI suppose you might calculate it if things have already escalated from \"preventative measure\" to \"there's obvious pain, but people are bogged down arguing over where to start\". Then you could identify a subset of relevant components, calculate their I metrics, and consider how helpful refactoring out some of those dependencies would be."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskProgramming. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "The code is not enough documentation. Why do you hate writing docs?\n\nI have a bone to pick with developers who use the \"The code is documentation enough\"-meme to avoid actually writing documentation. And I would love to hear your rationalizations on this. \n\nI'm an RPA Developer which means I basically use every tool I have to force systems to work together, that were not designed to work together. When I started out, there were about 30 processes already in automation. When I got into my support duties, and started to try and debug, I was constantly running to my seniors, not because of logic-related questions, but because there was almost no documentation regarding the involved systems.\n\nFor example, I almost shot down book keeping because no one bothered to write down, how clicking a button in a certain software promted automated charges towards customers, including emails and actual letters that would be issued - reversing those charges would've been a nightmare, all because the process failed during execution, and needed to be restarted, but in order to restart the process \"properly\", and not cause duplicates, i'd have to adjust some settings first. \n\nNone of which was written downm, and in my eyes, that a pretty important detail. I had to ask. Now I just always ask if its something new (and theres no documentation) and let me tell you, theres ALWAYS something new (to me), and documentation is ALWAYS missing. \n\nOr spending 2 hours trying to figure out a quite contained logic error, which couldve been solved by the original developer within a couple of minutes, but you know.. no one wrote down anything. \n\nHow about actually extending the functionality of a process/feature? I need to first spend about 6 hours trying to figure out how the original process even works or was intended to work in the first place to understand where my extension fits in with the rest of the design. Could be only 1 or maybe 2 hours of looking at the code, if you bothered to write proper documentation, so I'd know where entry- and exit points are.\n\nIts not about me not wanting to do the leg work, this is about me not wanting to waste time, only to to it wrong anyways, because I misunderstood or misinterpreted.\n\nSo no, the code is not documentation enough, no one knows the interactions between systems/methods as well as the original developer, and if you'd like to not be bothered all the time by your collegues with seemingly stupid questions, THEN WRITE THE DOCUMENTATION.\n\nThis has made me an absolute narc when it comes to documentation. Like AT LEAST write down the critical sht for gods sake.", "assistant": "I don't mind writing documentation since I start with \"pen and paper\" anyway and I could reuse that. But the problem is a bit higher, at the customer's level. In the first few years of a project's life, investors or whoever just request features one by one and often times these contradict each other. Any module documentation you'll start is obsolete by the time you clarify requirements, and then when you implement a feature, and then when you fix a bug, and then when you introduce a change.\n\nWith that said, look at open source projects. They lack proper documentation too. It is there, but it is often poorly organized. Look at Kubernetes, for example. It's a nightmare.\n\nSo while we can all agree a good documentation could save us time, we often don't have resources to keep it up to date. And then, we don't have good editors."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskProgramming. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Am I Remotely Qualified to Call Myself a Software Dev/Programmer?\n\nHi everyone, my question is mainly towards professional software devs/programmers. I am 30, have never worked in professional IT and would like to gauge my programming proficiency. I want to know if I am even remotely qualified for a junior programming job - whether it is a career option open to me.\n\nTo give you some background, I have always been very tech-savvy but mainly in the hardware department, like DIY-build a desktop and fixing computers/Windows issues, but I have never studied programming or Computer Science - hence nothing fit for the latest IT job market boom.   \nFor university, I hold a Master in Astrophysics. I self-learnt Python many years ago, but did not have any real experience until my Master thesis in 2020. Most notably, I improved on the 3D stellar orbit fitting code that my research group already was using, I reverse-engineered it to do the opposite - to extrapolate positions based on an orbit. I also wrote a bunch of utility/automation scripts for personal use - like plotting overview charts with labels, timelines showing 50-observations...etc.\n\nAs you can already see, I was nowhere near the \"professional\" league, nor could any of these use cases be translated to IT experience. At the time, ChatGPT didn't exist, so I did not learn how to write \"clean codes\", or the most efficient ways to write something. Whatever I wrote, was based on a lot of google, stack-overflow and editing.   \nIn the last 3 years, I worked as an Engineer without touching programming. I knew I wouldn't get hired in IT field anyway, as I never attended any bootcamps or had any certificates, and my tech \"stack\" is only Python, which seems to be very rare among job postings?\n\n...Until now. Since last month, I have been working (completely solo, no support) to develop a real-time noise monitoring program in a small company, which polls data from sound meters every second, upload and store it in a SQL-database, then can be access through a website. Since I am the only person in the company who can program, this ambitious project/idea was therefore assigned to me.\n\nAs an ex-scientist, I meticulously research and plan things first. I had zero experience with SQL and HTML/CSS/JS which I found that I had to use. I figured things out (alone) every step of the way, with ChatGPT/Google/Stack Overflow/Reddit for help. Mainly I rely on ChatGPT to do the heavylifting and ask to explain new syntax/concepts. \n\nI have been making great progress on the project and learnt much more than I could have ever imagined. \n\n**I am a very precise and inquisitive person - I am specific and meticulous with my prompts, so I almost always get GPT to do exactly what I want.**   \n**I read every line of the code it gives me, as I take it as a learning opportunity/exercise - I make comments on almost every line/loop/if statement in the codes/functions to help me keep track of the logic flow and how to write something.**   \n**I also ask a lot of follow-up questions to GPT about new syntaxes, concepts and their limitations - I test every function, every possible exceptions/scenarios that I can come up with, debug the codes myself and fix bugs/mistakes ChatGPT made (GPT has made quite a number of bugs/stupid mistakes so far).**\n\n**However, I cannot help but feel that I am not a \"real programmer\" because 90%+ of my code was written by ChatGPT.** \n\nOne of my programs has almost 1000 lines of code so far, all the logics/syntaxes used are basic enough that I can fully understand. However, for a piece of code that GPT can give me in 15 minutes, it would have easily taken me 1 week to write from scratch and debug, and I could never write it as robust and concise.\n\nMaybe it's a delusion, but I always have the impression that professional programmers can write codes with fluency like speaking English? After all it is what they do for a living, 8 hours a day. If professional programmers are native English speakers, I would be one who still struggles with the tenses, pronounces and prepositions.   \nMoreover, all the job postings I have seen require a diversed tech stack such as C, C++, JS...etc. I can't help but feel that I will immediately fail any code-test in an interview.\n\nIn addition, I feel that all the things I am learning right now are so basic, they are just exercises to people who took Computer Science in their Bachelors. \n\nBy my standards, so far I have not done any \"real\" software engineering. I am a physicist/architect who tell an engineer to build something I designed. I may be able to come up with the plans/requirements, draw some blueprints, supervise, test, debug and fix any bugs; but I did not really build anything. At best I am a...test engineer? code-debugger? \n\nAll this being said, I have no plans to switch to the IT field currently, but I want to know if I am selling myself short. I feel that I have no chance competing with CS grads with rigorous training on the job market, but somehow I am able to miraculously develop a piece of software from scratch without prior education and senior's support, and somehow, *it just works*. That should count for something?  \nSo, do you think I am remotely qualified to call myself a junior software dev/programmer?", "assistant": "\\> I have been working (completely solo, no support) to develop a real-time noise monitoring program in a small company, which polls data from sound meters every second, upload and store it in a SQL-database, then can be access through a website\n\nThis is a hilariously complicated project for an employer that doesn't know anything about app development to just throw on one person because they've written some Python scripts before.\n\nIf you can do this project yourself, you can absolutely call yourself a software developer, and a professional one at that since you are getting paid to do it. \n\nAs for the ChatGPT thing, sounds like you are using it in a very constructive way for your learning, making sure you understand each response very clearly before moving on. This is equivalent to using Google to teach yourself, only you are saving an enormous amount of time.\n\n\\> I always have the impression that professional programmers can write codes with fluency like speaking English?\n\nWhen developers are working on the same project with the same tools every day for a month, they can usually sit down and write out a good bit of code just off the top of their head. If I use a library/framework that I haven't used in like 3 months, I will certainly have to Google things, and by that I mean ask ChatGPT about them.\n\nIdk if you necessarily have the experience to join the IT field now, but finish that web app and, in general, start trying to look for more ways to incorporate some coding into your daily work. Maybe work on a decently impressive personal project. Putting those things on your resume ought to get you a couple looks at least and probably more if you apply to jobs in the astronomy field given your experience and education.\n\nGlhf"}

I want to give my friends and other interested parties the files, but I also want to include a simple application that they can open and use to select which file they want to read on their computer so they don't have to sit through a long .txt file to read my directions for navigating, or going through folder after subfolder to look at all the available items. Most of my friends love to read and are really curious but are honestly not that adept at working with computer so I want to make something very simple for them to use. \n\nIn my mind, its a program that just displays like any old terminal and it has the names of the folders. If you type an input like the name of the folder, it then displays all the available subfolders and then if you give an input the same way, it opens subfolders in those subfolders, and so on and so forth until it brings you to the actual file list. At this point the program displays a list of titles with a number next to it, and if you enter the number it opens the selected file in the computer's default way to view that file type.\n\nNow, I have already made this concept in html and it works fine, but I want to rely on something other than a browser and the assumption that there will be a built-in way for the browser to display a pdf or an epub file.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskProgramming. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Problem with Project Architecture\n\n**Intro:**  \nSo, I'm currently at the second semester in a higher technical school in Informatics and we have a project, that needs to be finished the 21.09.25.   \nThe Project is about a Contact Manager App, that needs to be build using Windows Forms as the Frontend and C#. \n\n**Situation:**  \nI have started building the App using Domain Driven Design and Clean Architecture, since my intentions are to learn about the Architecture / Design.   \nI know Domain Driven Design in combination with Clean Code is Overkilled / Overengineered, but i wanted to use this Project for learning purposes, so I'm also prepared for future and more advance applications and also have gained some experience with different approaches. \n\n  \n**Problem:**  \nyesterday i was talking to my Lecturer and showing him my advancements in the Projekt and he said it was too overkilled, that the Projekt wasn't meant to have such an advanced Topic, that we even haven't yet learned about Interfaces in Programing Foundation.   \nAnd that i should go for KISS.  \nLike better use a MVVM or MVC and that i need to implement a OOD that they made and show in the Project description, or else the project counts as Failed.  \nI have already finished all the Bounded context and planning and also build the Projekt structure using Clean Architecture. I'm almost finishing building all the value Objects. So, I'm sort of in the middle of my project with the D.D.D and clean architecture.\n\nI don't want to start from scratch to be honest, and it is now really demotivating that i need to stop in mid project and change the whole architecture so i can meet the expectations and the OOD that they expect.   \nI was thinking about keeping all the value object and also sort of do a combination of both. But i don't know, these is where i need your help guys.  \nDo you have some advice?  \n\n**Questions:**  \n\\- What would you recommend in my Situation?  \n\\- How can i change from D.D.D/Clean architecture to MVC or MVVM?  \n\\- Can i do sort of a combination?", "assistant": "There's multiple ways to attack this question, its a good question though cause architecture is kind of an after thought in many courses. \n\nBut I'm gonna be real with you before answering so you understand the point of view from inside the industry... Architecture very often ends up becoming an after thought on the job too, to drastically varying degrees depending on funding, time, and the team you're on. It might not seem like it, but there are certainly times to do things the \"wrong way\" when coding. Sometimes you have a deadline and you need to show the client a working application. And you'll know that you're doing things quick and dirty, and you will want to spend hours and hours perfecting the exact architecture you learned about exactly as the Computer Science god intended.... \n\nBut the client/project doesn't give a shit if you optimized their app by 0.01% or if you've set up things in a way that will save your team hours of dev time 10 months from now when things get complicated. Your job is not to code, coding easy and you just gotta keep practicing. Programming as a job is about solving problems. If the goal is to make a blue box show up on the screen, then the client doesnt give two shits about clean code, language choice, or future saved time. \n\n\nAnd here's another secret. There's situations where I dont care either. If I want to build out a script to do something and no one else is gonna see it or use it.... there's a non-zero chance I'm throwing everything in single file and littering the thing with print statements to solve bugs because I'm too stubborn in the moment to google the issue. But if I get what I wanted out of the dogs hit code I wrote for that simple script, Im satisfied. \n\n\nAnother thing to consider is that these frameworks are frameworks, not gospel. You may not realize this but you can do a bunch of rendering of the front end of say a website on the server, not gonna go into why at this level, but this is not some crazy unhinged idea. It's called server side rendering and has multiple use cases that you dont need to worry about. OK. Think about what that might look like. Your view is obviously the visual front end. The model is represents information. And the controller is linking them and doing business logic stuff. But a beginner might have their head explode if there's \"view\" stuff hiding in the backend if you are rendering certain \"view\" things on the server...\n\nDo we take our SSR code and just... shove it into the controller? That might not make sense... is it information and should it go with our models? Maybe not... do we.... yaddayadda you can ask these questions endlessly and argue endlessly about why you're right and how we need to figure this problem out. And all the experienced programmers said \"ima just make a new folder and now I have MVC+section for my SSR stuff\" and have moved on to implementing new features. \n\nMVC is great, especially for web stuff when you start a project, but very often as projects grow your beautiful MVC will grow into somwthing else that you might not find in a textbook. Consistency is important and documentation is important. Ive worked python jobs where the team was using camel case and all the documentation about the project said to use camel case. No programmer is going to care at all and bring up how we really need to switch to snake_case so we maintain proper pythonic code. Thats crazy talk. Programming is just like that, and as you add complexity and people to a project it gets worse and worse. Find the most perfect piece of code you can or the optimal framework proven by social experiments done on devs and it will take you exactly 10 seconds to find an experienced dev who will tell you that that perfect code is garbage and you need to do things their way. \n\n\n\nArchitecture is important and is a skill for sure, but you will succeed if you don't worry too much about it the way you are now. If you understand MVC, thats great because you'll be able to read code organized that way when youre on the job. But you wont be deciding that when you start your first job or join a project. Someone else already did that or is doing that and your job is to read the documentation and put the correct code where it needs to, and very often the reason for that is READABILITY so devs can do dev things more efficiently. \n\n\n\nRefactoring code is rewriting it for readability or efficiency. Imagine you have your perfect MVC program but for some reason a line of controller code doesnt work. You try everything from rewriting to praying and nothing. And a teammate takes your code and puts it into a different file and it works. Crazy bugs happen, maybe the version of your language has some super niche issue that was resolved in a later update... maybe your computer hates you. Who cares why right now. And who cares if your beautiful MVC program has suddenly become MVC+another C. Go back to that later when you have the chance to refactor, right now you dont because the client (your teacher) has a deadline. The code works. \n\n\nI know i didnt reference a lot of real code stuff, but if you havent learned interfaces yet then you've got a lot of really cool tools coming to you soon that will fill in those gaps. We all want to do things exactly as we view it in our head, thats not how programming works. You might start with a good foundation, but architecture is NOT just how you organize your folders. If using MVVM is better but requires your team to learn where all the code they wrote is hiding as they learn, then MVVM is not better. Your job is to build a thing, and overengineering and overcomplicating things is a trap thats easy to fall into. Your code will never be perfect, and you can always organize things better, justify putting something in place A instead of place B, or eak out a little bit more performance. But as a programmer it doesn't matter in many situations. \n\nYou have X amount of time to build Y. If Y is a silly little calculator app that a client is paying you hourly to build, they're not gonna appreciate your perfect architecture and clean code that took you 40 extra billable hours to build. They just want their app, put the app in the bag and try to stick to literally any framework that you and your team understand. Soon you'll learn different design patterns for different situations. And youll find people making millions of dollars off of apps using the \"worst\" design pattern ever just because the devs used what they were comfortable with. \n\n\nAnd youre gonna rewrite code a lot over your career, so heres a little tough love recommendation that I dont mean to come across as overly mean but helpful... get used to it, its good practice and not waste if time. Annoying? Sure. So is watching your perfect architecture slowly devolve into a steaming pile of dogshit as new files and features that dont quite fit into the perfect Clean Code or MVC paradigm are added. Programming about solving problems and building stuff, design patterns are just another tool you have to do those things, they are not laws that must be followed or else. And sometimes its unavoidable to bend those rules the design patterns seem to be telling you. \n\n\nTldr; I believe you're getting ahead of yourself and not seeing the big picture. Design patterns are good tools to have, not laws that all programs follow to the letter. Dont be discouraged, you're learning something that takes a lot of devs a long time to realize. Stop worrying as much about the fancy buzzwords and build the thing the client wants in the time frame they are paying you to. The design patterns youre working with are for YOU the dev to be able to navigate and organize your code."}

The signature is stored in a publically accessible database of signatures belonging to adult users\n3. When the user wants to access an age-restricted platform, he/she queries the database for a random selection of public keys.\n4. The user combines the keys together with his/her private signature, and issues an authorizing request. By the design of ring signatures, so it's impossible to tell which *adult* user from the random selection hashed it. \n\nThe restricted service can be accessed without identifying oneself.

The idea was that you could compile to bytecode and run the binaries anywhere that had a Java VM. But in reality cross-platform desktop applications are rare and Java found its home mainly on servers.

So why not skip the JVM middle-man and just compile it to native machine code? \n\nWhy is JVM so popular when few organizations actually utilize it's main selling point? You could just define the Java spec such that it was easy to recompile for different architectures. You usually have to package it separately for different platforms anyway. Just add a recompile in there when building distributables.\n\nC# is even more strange to me because originally it was never even really intended to run on anything but Windows.

I see a common practice of people forking a huge amount of popular repositories. For example, looking at some profiles on GitHub I see that 90 percent of their repositories are just forked repositories that they didn't write pull requests for, and really did no work on.\n\nWhy do people do this?

You would want to set characteristic or methods to the highest-level class where those characteristics are shared, e.g. a \"mammal\" class could have a characteristic \"warm-blooded\", so any subclass of mammal would also have that characteristic.

I was able to build a fully functional CRUD web app using C# (Minimal API), SQLite, Tailwind CSS (standalone), and JavaScript. All of the C# code was written by me, and I even wrote some JS myself which is mostly fetch() calls and response handling to communicate with my C# backend.\n\nHowever, I've heavily relied on AI-generated code for my frontend which is HTML, CSS (using Tailwind), animations (like slide bars), and dynamic JS functions for inserting and displaying data. When I finished the project, it felt good at first, but that hype quickly died when I quickly reminded that I barely built the frontend myself. It didn’t feel like it was “my” work anymore.\n\nNow, on my second project, things started to fall apart. The AI-generated frontend and JavaScript animations didn’t work properly. Even functions that worked with dummy values before I integrated my actual data response from C# suddenly broke when integrated. I debugged as much as I could but a day already had past and it just drained all of my energy.\n\nSo I’ve decided that I want to step back and truly learn JavaScript.

My thought process is this makes it easier to test and scale in the future.

Feels like any sort of meaningful testing that could be done will already cross the line of integration testing, otherwise all you're testing is a try/catch where you always fail to connect.\n\nA real life example of a project I'm working on has: \n\n1. An endpoint that receives an authentication code from the front-end, and sends it to the 3rd party auth provider to verify it. \n2. A method that gets the authCode returned from step 1 to get the user info from the same 3rd party provider. \n3. A method that takes the results from step 2 to get from the database additional info for that user, and returns it to the front end. \n\nIn that case, what benefits do I get from unit testing? Front end is no different for me, most functions are either visual controls to show/hide elements, or methods to execute api calls, what kind of business logic am I testing in the front end? \n\nI'm ashamed to admit the amount of years of experience I have on the field and the lack of experience in the topic, but it's genuinely something that I haven't encountered at work (yet), and whenever I try to find information about it I can't seem to find real examples of it being used, it's always bare-basic examples of a calculator app doing basic math, and simply testing the results of 2+2, but never going any further than that (which I also feel is an issue with programming content in general). \n\nJust now when googling I found [this thread from 13 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/dl0d4/is_unit_testing_worth_the_effort/) talking about the same thing, and the answers seem to be about as I expected, but contradicting what the general population, managers, and talks seem to argue.", "assistant": "\\> you always fail to connect\n\nYou need to \"mock\" the parts not under test to make meaningful unit tests.\n\nYour program needs to have been designed for testability for this to work.

There are surely much better ways to organize code. For example, classes could be organized according to their hierarchies, synchronous methods according to their call stack, and asynchronous methods according to what they're associated with (or something). Compilation units can be divided up programmatically, or user-determined, but would be decoupled from where the code is stored in files.\n\nEven if I can use IDE tools that allow me to explore the call stack of functions or class hierarchies, I still feel like a lot of the time I spent trying to organize code is grappling with how that code is best organized into files, and like there's no reason to be keeping that experience around.\n\nEdit: Some common things I see popping up so far\n\n1: I am not saying we need to change how code is stored on disk. I am asking why the way we store code on disk does not need to be coupled with the way we organize code for programmers, the way it is presented. \n\n2: I am not trying to give a specific account of how we should organize code, just saying that surely better ways exist than coupling it to storage. I think a graphical representation that represents the control flow of the program is one such example, but if there are issues with this I don't think it answers the larger question of why we don't want a different - any different - representation system.", "assistant": "Nah - organise your storage by how you want your code structured."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskProgramming. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "JavaScript objects have complete parity with their JSON representations; is this an exclusive feature, or could I do the same with another language?\n\nHi! I'm an amateur web developer (backend and frontend) who started out with PHP, moved to Ruby on Rails, and is now trying out Node and ExpressJS with Vue for the frontend. \n\nI like how simple and lightweight Express seems to be so far, especially for building API-only applications like I'm currently working on. The use of JavaScript allows me to define an object prototype, then do pretty much whatever I want with it: be it storage in a MongoDB database (via Mongoose or a similar library), or sending through a REST API as a JSON object. In the case of Mongoose, I can even add, remove, and modify columns in my database without having to do any convoluted migrations (not to mention how easy it is to nest objects)!\n\nHowever, I have a few grievances with JavaScript and Node.\n\nFor one, it's not particularly resource-efficient. Even though Node and Express are rather lightweight, especially compared to frameworks such as Ruby on Rails (usually the \"convention over configuration\"-style ones), and the V8 engine tries its best to run JavaScript quickly, the language is far too slow and resource-hungry, and has many problems regarding threading (not to mention its notoriously awful developer ecosystem, full of spammy, useless, and malicious packages, and unhelpful guides). I also know JavaScript rather well, but would definitely prefer to use a language like Java, C#, Python, or Lua that I have more experience with (the added benefits being improved performance, better multithreading capabilities and more, for some of these at least). I'm an amateur developer, and don't have much of a budget for expensive cloud servers and compute services, so resource efficiency is very important for me, especially server-side.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest reasons why I want to keep using server-side JavaScript, despite its objective awfulness, is that working with objects is very, very convenient. Let's say I want to make a `User` object with a `name` and `password`. To do that with ExpressJS and Mongoose, I just have to define a schema as a regular JS object, register it as a Mongoose model, and do whatever I want from there. What if I want to send the `User` model as JSON? I can just do `response.send(user)`, and the `User` object I've selected (`user`) will get turned into a JSON string and sent to the client; it's easy, predictable, and intuitive, seeing as JSON is just a native textual representation of a JavaScript object. It's a similar process for creating, updating, deleting, etc. any kind of resource I want. As far as I know, you can't replicate that kind of thing with any other language. What's worse is that many of my favourite languages, like C# for example, only have frameworks available for them that are incredibly flawed or that I don't really like, such as ASP.NET with its confusing docs and awful \"Entity Framework\" for data storage, or Java's Spring with its irritatingly enterprise-focused design (although I don't have much experience with it, so I can't say how good of a thing that actually is).\n\nIs there any way I could create backend web applications in one of my preferred languages, like C#, Java, Python, Lua, etc., while still keeping the simplicity and ease-of-use that makes things like ExpressJS and MongoDB so attractive to me?\n\nI apologise for writing an essay's worth of text, but I really felt like this was an important thing for me to explain and get right.\n\nEDIT: after I took some time to think about this further, I realised a few things.\n\nFor one, Lua and it's \"table\" structure seems like a good candidate, since I know Lua quite well (it's a very simple language), and tables are very similar to JavaScript objects (Lua also has the same kind of pleasant simplicity as JavaScript in numerous other places). If you know any good Lua frameworks, let me know!", "assistant": "I’m confused by this question. \n\nJSON is a data serialization format. Other languages can both serialize and deserialize their native equivalents through often included libraries.\n\nIt’s the data exchange lingua Franca of the web.\n\nThere are implementations and frameworks in multiple languages that can also interact with databases and stuff strictly through your languages object model (ORMs) or tools like Pydantic that make your objects match 1-1 with a external data source or easier to just serialize into whatever format you need."}

I have worked on it for a while now, as it is currently in use, so I'm always looking for ways to improve it. It uses both front end and back end development, so it touches base on a few different languages like MySQL and PHP. The issue I'm having is I have never taken a proper course on web development. Yes, of course, I took basic computer science courses, such that went over Python or Java but never has it scraped front/back end web development. This means that I taught myself all of what I know, with little use of a formal online course to develop my understanding. That being said, there are a lot of holes in my programming knowledge, especially when dealing with the structure of a site. I have absolutely no clue how websites are managed and coded on professional levels, and extremely doubtful that how I designed the website is orthodox and not \"bad\" code. Where can I find examples of what practical basic websites look like? How can I learn how to practically structure/code websites, even on a larger scale? My website holds important information, how do I know it is safe from cyber attacks?

The biggest hurdle so far is that the camera has no digital or analogue video outputs, only an ethernet jack for network monitoring. In order to get a live viewfinder for my handheld rig, I am using a Raspberry Pi 4 model B running Raspberry Pi OS Lite to convert the IP based video stream into an HDMI output.\n\nSo far it has been very successful.

The header files basically form your \"public API\" which can be shared.  Developers are even free to swap implementations by swapping the c files and leaving the headers.  You can also hide the implementation and not release the source, just the headers.\n\nNote.  In some IDEs and build setups (like Arduino) the pre-processor will auto pre-declare most functions and I believe they use the compiler flag to keep going on error negating the concerns on ordering.

These are written in a high level programming language, typically using a popular *web framework* for the given language (e.g., Python has Flask, Java has Spring, JavaScript has Express.js, etc.). To actually deploy these servers, you have a lot of \"cloud\" options. Heroku is very popular these days for the hobbyist web application developer, but the big cloud providers (Google, Amazon, etc.) also have options as well. You're looking for a Platform as a Service (PaaS) option - all you have to do is write the API application code, and whatever service you choose will handle the underlying infrastructure. See [this example](https://stackabuse.com/deploying-a-flask-application-to-heroku/) for deploying a simple Python web app to Heroku (note, there is no database in that example).\n\nBut now you're probably wondering - if the application server exposes the API endpoints that retrieve or manipulate my data, *where is the actual data*? That is where databases come in. The database is a separate piece of the puzzle that the application server connects to via some sort of connection string and interacts with some via sort of database library designed for both the programming language your server is in, as well as the kind of database you're using (sometimes you can even opt for something called an *Object-Relational Mapper*, or ORM, but I won't go into detail on those). So when you make an HTTP GET request to read data about a user, the application server has logic in the /user/{1} endpoint that uses a library to query the database for the needed information, which is then returned as JSON (usually) back to the client that made the API request. This is then what a frontend would consume to display the information.\n\nAs for which kind of database to use, there are many, many options. The biggest decision many developers face these days is the SQL vs. NoSQL question, and there are pros and cons to each. The best choice will depend on more specific application requirements and features, but for a dating app the argument could likely be made for both. If you're completely new to databases and data modeling, the traditionalist would recommend you start learning SQL first - it teaches you a lot about how to think about business problems in terms of *entities* and their *relationships*, which is a skill you'd need for either paradigm but in my opinion is more straightforward when you're first learning SQL (others may disagree but eh  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯  ). Data modeling can be tricky and there are entire university classes dedicated to the subject, but understanding how to get data into the 3rd normal form in a relational database is a good start (see [this article](https://medium.com/@kimtnguyen/relational-database-schema-design-overview-70e447ff66f9)).\n\nIn either case, there are many different flavors of both SQL and NoSQL, but I would recommend PostgreSQL for SQL or MongoDB for NoSQL. There are plenty of other good options, but these two are widely used, capable, and well documented. Whatever PaaS provider you chose for your application server will very likely also offer a database hosting feature as well, but feel free to mix and match as you desire."}

For example, can you make an application which takes orders and stores them in a database and then allows you to read and modify that database?

Because I don't even have a concrete idea of how my algorithm would work, I often end up getting stuck and going nowhere.\n\nFor instance, given a Binary Tree problem, I'll start with a recursive algorithm but even before I figure out how the algorithm should work, I try to identify what methods I should create, how that method should call itself, what global variables I should maintain, etc. Eventually, since I don't even know what my algorithm should look like, I often end up getting stuck.\n\nSo, what is the right way one should approach a programming problem?

For context, I'm currently pursing a CE major focusing in digital hardware. I've always disliked programming but I don't understand why. Maybe it was the way it was introduced to me, since my first time learning to program was via some summer course my parents signed me up for. Learning to program always felt like such a struggle, but I never felt that satisfaction of solving problems with code that everyone else seems to feel. I tried to change that by joining my HS robotics team so I could help work with a goal in mind, but everything I did felt so insignificant compared to my peers that it made me feel worse. I got this interest in digital hardware and hardware design specifically because of a summer experience that felt rewarding and worthwhile, but the majority of my undergrad courses have been just programming. None of it feels interesting, but all of these courses are required because the majority of the CE concentrations deal with SW. The only courses I've truly enjoyed have been those related to HW design. However, its come to the point that I have been relying so much on AI to help expedite the process that I realized in the event I do need this, I can't do anything meaningful.

(positive or negative)\n\nI'm currently studying applied informatics at university and while I'm using AI regularly as a tool and rubber ducky, I've been seeing an increasing amount of students that practically only code using AI. Speaking with them, they often seem to lack basic understanding of (object-oriented) programming and the code they're writing. They argue that it's best to start working with it closely ASAP, sometimes they're even encouraged by our professors, and in all fairness, it is often good enough for our uni assignments. But I just can't see this approach working once you have to deal with larger codebases that are maintained by multiple people and over long periods of time.\n\nBut that's just my assumption as I've never programmed professionally for a company. What have been your experiences so far? Is AI really as common, and useful, as it's made out to be or are we still at the point where it causes more issues than it's worth? How do companies typically approach AI these days, fully embrace it or are they still cautious?", "assistant": "Hi, I'm a software engineer with two decades of experience in big tech.\n\nThings are changing literally day-to-day. A few months ago, there's maybe a bit of model-assisted autocomplete, smart-paste if you're lucky. It was still pretty fringe to do prompt-driven coding. As of now pretty much all of FAANG is \\*\\*mandating\\*\\* adoption of AI in coding workflow. It's not that you're being forced to vibe code, but you are expected to at least try to use the tools. Importantly, you're expected to be more efficient as a result, no matter how good or bad the models are. It still remains to be seen what will happen to those who resist; we will start to find out over the next 1-2 years as these things start showing up in performance reviews.\n\nHonestly, the models are getting better. They are taking on bigger tasks, and able to solve harder problems. But I find it still gets it wrong about half of the time. But this is the biggest risk - the LLMs' greatest successes and most staggering failures are presented with equal confidence. AI is built to make code that LOOKS correct, and it does so VERY convincingly (and more so every day) . If code isn't reviewed with a highly critical eye, you will end up submitting some catastrophically bad code.\n\nThis Short, while tongue-in-cheek, I feel is a very accurate representation of what it's like to use these models right now in real-life professional software development: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SKs45GSHCwM/](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SKs45GSHCwM/).\n\nHow does it work with bigger codebases, with more developers, over longer time? Actually, better! Ideally, you're tuning the model itself on your codebase. But even if you're not, these models code way better when given context. The more examples and more references from your own code you can give it in your prompt, the better it will do.\n\n**Coming back to the topic at hand (sorry for winding path), what does this mean for your university studies?**\n\n1. Start practicing now on how to use these AIs. It's harder than it sounds to use these things well. Things may be different in a few years, but AI is unlikely to just go away. You will need to be up-to-date on it when you enter the workforce.\n2. Use this time at school to also learn coding by hand. Practice, a LOT! Code with other humans on collaborative projects as much as you can. Whether or not you ever write a line of code professionally without an LLM, you will need the skills that you can only learn through practicing without one."}

However, there is an Amazon headquarters in Arlington now and they use a little bit of everything. \n\nOracle headquarters is also in Northern Virginia.  As is a couple divisions of Microsoft.  Northern Virginia is basically where all the AWS and Azure jobs are.  It's the heaviest hot spot on the internet where most of the world's internet traffic passes through.  The main oceanic fiber line leaves the va coast somewhere near norfolk, which is the largest US Navy base as well.  So from Northern Virginia to South Carolina there are a lot of data centers.

Highly recommend rust. It's really gaining traction. \n\nBut rust isn't necessarily going to find you a lot of jobs right now. \n\nAnd most the rust jobs evolve a lot of C++ porting so you kind of need to know both."}

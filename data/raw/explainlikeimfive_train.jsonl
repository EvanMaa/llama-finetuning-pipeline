Also is there a reason we don‚Äôt make a chocolate drink using cocoa beans ground up like coffee grounds? Would it just be too bitter?", "assistant": "edit: RIP my inbox\n*Coffee cherries are their own fruit from the coffee tree.  We do not make coffee from the pits of the cherries we eat.  Please do not try this.  You could die. Thank you.\n\nFirst off, remember that coffee is the roasted seed of a cherry that is pulverized in a grinder, while tea is actual dried leaves from the tea plant.  Because we can grind coffee really coarsely or super fine, we control the extraction time to get the proper strength from the coffee.  Finer grind has more surface area (i.e. espresso), and we can get all the good stuff out in under 30 seconds.  A big, coarse grind like for french press, can take 4 minutes.  As for why we don't use coffee bags regularly, it's for a couple of reasons.  Coffee stales very quickly once ground, much faster than tea.  It also has to do with 'fines'.  Because coffee is a brittle, organic seed, when it is ground, you get a range of particles from large to small.  You'd need a bag permeable enough to let the coffee steep and for water to move through it, but also not allow all of the fine particles through.  This is simple with gravity brewing like pour over or drip because the water will eventually get out.  It's not really moving if it is in a bag in a cup, so the filter would have to allow for the smaller stuff to wind up in the cup and your coffee will be 'muddy'.  This happens with french press too, and some people enjoy the body of this type of coffee for that reason.\n \nTea, on the other hand, more or less behaves the same, and needs to be steeped for several minutes to get the most flavor from it.  Chopping the leaves up finer helps somewhat, but it seriously affects the flavor of the tea, as breaking the leaves causes them to lose a lot of their essential oils and flavor.  If you've ever had a really nice loose leaf black tea next to, say, Liptons bagged tea, there's no comparison.  So, yes, you could mill up tea leaves small enough to make a drip machine make 'tea', but it probably wouldn't be very nice.\n\nYour last question about cocoa - Chocolate is the most complicated process of the 3.  Cacao beans are fermented, dried, roasted, dechaffed, ground, pressed with sugar, blended with cocoa liquor....  It's a crazy process that I can't understand how we figured out it was possible in the first place.  If the roasted 'cocoa bean', or cacao nib were just ground up and steeped, it would be very bitter, and probably not to your taste, but this was basically what was drank by the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica (with added chili and spices for some fire).  Instead, we just make sweetened cocoa powder that is ground super fine, kinda water soluble and we drink the 'grinds', unlike coffee."}

Many characteristics thought to be \"genetic\" (like intelligence or criminality) are influenced by a vast interplay of genetics and environment, making simplistic genetic manipulation both scientifically incorrect and impossible.\n\nAs our understanding of genetics has advanced, scientists have come to realize that traits are influenced by complex interactions between multiple genes and environmental factors. This makes the goals of eugenics (such as the elimination of undesirable traits) unrealistic and scientifically unsound.

Rules that determine how it works.\n\n2. An interpreter or a compiler that will run it.\n\nA compiler is a program that reads the program and translates it into code in another, usually lower level, language. That language can run using existing program or directly on the processor (if it's machine code). An interpreter is a program that reads the program and runs it on the fly.\n\nYes, the compiler and interpreter are simply written in other languages. When the language becomes usable enough, you can even write a compiler for a language using its own language (for example modern C compilers are written in C).\n\n> how was the first one created?\n\n1. The lowest level of programming is machine code. Machine code is binary (0s and 1s) and it is hardwired into the CPU - the circuits are designed to interpret machine code. In order to write machine code, programmers had to actually write 0s and 1s (usually on [punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card)).\n\n2. The first actual programming languages are [Assembly languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language). Assembly is just a human-readable way to present machine code, for example instead of writing `10110000 01100001` in binary, you write `MOV AL, 61h` which means \"move the value 61 (in hex) into the register AL\". The compiler for this program is called an assembler. Early assemblers were written meticulously using machine code.\n\n3. Once assembly was available, it could be used to create higher level programming languages."}

If a warm, humid from meets a cold front, there will be rain, and the warm front will become less humid.

Specifically, nicotine is similar enough to something called¬†acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter which your body uses to activate muscles. This similarity means that your muscles get a somewhat unique and \"unexpected\" signal which may result in an unusual sensation, such as relaxation you're not normally used to while, e.g. standing up or moving. This feeling of relaxation can make you feel suddenly calmer, which is another way of your body \"tricking\" your mind: your muscles are suddenly less stressed, so surely you aren't THAT anxious, are you?\n\n\nOf course, other factors play a part, taking a break or going outside changes your environment and, over time, relief of withdrawal symptoms is certainly going to feel good - but the idea that nicotine itself has no effect other than being addictive is misleading."}

If we could remove those fats we would have a very good cooking oil with only healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.\n\nSo, why is it not possible to do this ?", "assistant": "Because the difference between the two molecules is pretty small. Unsaturated means that at least on if the carbon-carbon bonds in the fatty acid chain (which van be pretty long chains of carbon-carbon bonds with hydrogen to the side) is a double bond instead of a single bond, so not saturated with Hydrogen bonds.

A fire requires all three. This is why water is so effectively at putting out a fire. It robs it of air, and heat.\n\nOnce fuel like wood is hot enough it will start a chemical reaction where the compounds in it start to oxidize, the organic chemical parts of wood breakdown and react with air producing CO2, carbon, and water.\n\nThis process is exothermic, meaning that it releases energy in the form of heat, which causes a fire to be self-sustaining so long as there is enough fuel and oxygen available.\n\nFlames are the result of chemicals in the wood (in this case) vaporizing and burning in the air above the fire."}

So what's happening to cells when someone gets a little pink vs red vs blistered? And why does more sun exposure increase chances of skin cancer if these cells are dying? Is a mild sunburn more likely to lead to cancer because more mutated cells survive?", "assistant": "The redness & swelling (blisters) is the body's defense against dying/dead cells.  The amount depends on the amount and type of damage.  A little pink, like a flush, can just be increased blood flow as part of the healing process.  Blistering happens when more than just the top layer is damaged.  The layer it goes down to ends up separating from the healthy layer beneath that, and the gap starts to fill with serum (blister fluid) as it pushes antibodies and tries to combat infection & further damage.  The cells dying are a programmed response to the DNA damage; self destruct before affecting others.  Turning into cancer is when they don't die like they were supposed to, and instead mutate.  2nd degree (blistering) sunburn is more likely to turn cancerous."}

While reading a novel, have you ever read a section describing a female character that felt the need to talk about how attractive she was, or give curiously detailed information about her breasts, hair, lips or eyes? These are an example of \"the male gaze\" - it's when an ostensibly gender-neutral piece of media still \"feels\" like it's \"for\" men.\n\nThe female gaze is similar.\n\nDo you remember the tiny scene in Thor (the first one) where Thor/Chris Hemsworth is washing up at a sink? No dialogue, no plot, just a little scene of a shirtless Chris Hemsworth wiping himself down while the camera lingers on his body? There's nothing about that scene that's explicitly labelled \"This is for women\", but the scene demonstrates the female gaze. The camera is looking at Hemsworth as a sex object, as a straight women would.\n\nSo why does this matter?\n\nIt's because the male/female gaze can feel odd or even uncomfortable when it doesn't match your own proclivities, especially when it's gratuitous and constant. It also ties into some awkward territory about objectification.\n\nA straight man might enjoy seeing Megan Fox lean over a truck in hotpants in Transformers - straight women likely find it bland or annoying, or even gross. Likewise, a straight woman might have appreciated seeing Henry Cavill in the bathtub in the Witcher (or seeing the original scene it's based on), but straight men probably didn't - they likely felt something between neutral, uncomfortable or even awkward.\n\nThe male/female gaze isn't inherently a bad thing - it's natural that different sexualities view the world differently - but it's helpful to be aware of it, because it helps avoid some really skeevy stuff."}

The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. \n\nAnd no, I‚Äôm not a climate change denier. I‚Äôm trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.\n\n===========\n\n**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**\nI need to go to sleep. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I‚Äôve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. \n\nMain things I‚Äôve learned, based on Redditors‚Äô comments, for those just joining:\n\n* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2¬∞ warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can‚Äôt handle 2¬∞ warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4¬∞ less than it is today. The \"little ice age\" was just ~1-2¬∞ colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.\n\n* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**\n\n* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. \n\n* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could‚Äôve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). \n\n* The change in global average (not 2¬∞ local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.\n\n* The issue is not the 2¬∞ warmer temp. It is that those 2¬∞ could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2¬∞ difference can quickly become 20¬∞. The 2¬∞ may be our event horizon. \n\n* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I‚Äôm being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I‚Äôm still unclear on the details here.]\n\n* A major part of the issue is the timing. It‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There‚Äôs no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. \n\n* We don‚Äôt actually know exactly what will happen because it‚Äôs impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.", "assistant": "It's not just about the temperature getting a few degrees warmer. An effect of rising CO2 levels is that the global average temperature will get a few degrees warmer. That average temperature increase is a benchmark only, not the problem in and of itself. It's the other effects of the same root cause of increasing CO2 levels that are a problem.\n\nThe earth is a giant thermodynamic engine that takes in energy in higher amounts near the equator where solar gain is greater than heat radiated back into space, and funnels it to the poles, where solar gain is less than heat radiated to space. CO2 acts like a blanket over the system, keeping more heat in, but the equatorial zones don't heat much, they just shuttle that extra heat to the poles through ocean and wind currents. The same air currents also shuttle CO2 up to the poles, as can be seen in [this NASA model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04), which further reduces heat radiated back into space at the poles. This means that the poles are heating up a lot more than 2 degrees C. More like 10.\n\nThe bulk of earth's frozen water is at the poles, so this rise of several degrees Celsius in the polar regions will melt a significant amount of land based ice, raising sea levels. This is going to cost trillions of dollars to either preemptively try to deal with or as flood damage.\n\nIn addition, CO2 in the atmosphere is also absorbed into the oceans. As the CO2 levels in the ocean rise, the oceans acidify, due to the creation of carbonic acid, the same acid in your carbonated soda. You may have seen of heard of people dissolving baby teeth in a can of coke, and the same thing happens to carbonaceous minerals in acidified ocean water. So organisms with calcium carbonate shells like shellfish and coral grow slower and will likely soon reach the point where their structures are dissolving faster than they grow. This kicks the legs out of the base of the ocean's food web, and will largely collapse ocean life in near shore areas with the exception of algae and jellyfish.\n\nFinally, since the earth is currently being shifted out of equilibrium, the weather patterns are behaving like a top that is starting to topple, with extreme systems swinging across the globe. We are getting high pressure systems that park themselves over an area for weeks at a time, blasting the area with heat. In the ocean, this can kill corals, and much of the earth's coral reefs are already dying off as a result of these extended heat waves. Over land they reduce crop yields and can kill people. We have a circumpolar band of wind called the polar vortex that will start to meander, bringing snow to Florida and dropping temperatures across the Eastern US by 10-15 degrees C below normal in the middle of winter for weeks at a time, killing native plants and animals that aren't adapted to being able to survive that kind of cold for that long. These shifting weather patterns also change climate in areas, such that some areas will see extended drought such that there will no longer be enough water for the people that currently live there. In other areas, heavier rainfall increase flooding and landslide events, which cause millions to billions of dollars of damage to communities and kill people.\n\nAny time the world goes through a climactic shift, it becomes less habitable to the species that were adapted to the old patterns. Because of the interconnectedness of ecosystems, these effects ripple in a positive feedback loop that drives up extinction rates in a runaway process that can radically alter the biome. This is not good for humans in the short run or the long run."}

So for a 5 year old:**\n\nThe space station doesn't run out of air because NASA got really really good at recycling the things they already have on the station. They have some magic machines up there that can turn water into air. So then where do they get the water, you ask? From the astronauts pee, from their showers, from their sweat, from the humidity in the air. They turn that gross, weird water into drinkable / air-making-able water. BUT eventually they'll run out. SO they send up a fun little gas called hydrogen (which is a thing that's in water, but way way lighter than water and therefore cheaper and easier to send up) and they combine that with the stuff the astronauts breathe out (CO2) using yet another magic machine that makes water.\n\n**Full explanation:**\n\nElectrolysis of water (H2O) is the main method to generate oxygen aboard the ISS. Water is split into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen (H2). The oxygen is vented into the breathable cabin air system, known as the Oxygen Generation System, while the explosive hydrogen is vented externally. \\[EDIT1\\] Check the edit below, it seems like they don't vent the hydrogen anymore and instead reuse it to make more water.\n\nThe station‚Äôs football-field-sized solar arrays are the power source to electrolyse the water. Each day the OGS continuously provides between 2.3 and 9kg (5 to 20lbs) of oxygen. The OGS is a component of the ISS life support system, known as ECLSS or Environmental Control and Life Support System, located in the US Destiny module. The Elektron system aboard the Russian Zvezda service module performs the same vital electrolysis service for the ISS crew. The Electron system was also used aboard the Russian Mir Space Station.\n\nPressurized oxygen storage tanks replenished by visiting unmanned cargo ships provide a backup to the electrolysis method. Finally, the crew can also generate oxygen chemically by igniting Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters comprised of lithium perchlorate. Each canister provides the oxygen needed to support one crew member for one day.\n\nFrom: [https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/do-they-make-oxygen-to-breathe-on-the-iss/](https://www.spaceanswers.com/space-exploration/do-they-make-oxygen-to-breathe-on-the-iss/)\n\nAs for where the water comes from, after reading an article on NASA.org, it's mostly recycled. They have systems that efficiently gather all the water. This includes moisture in the air, sweat, urine, and shower water that was unused. ~~There's also apparently another Russian space station that has a large stock pile.~~ They don't usually ship more water from earth because it's so expensive but they can and do sometimes.\n\nThe NASA article: [https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov\\_1](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast02nov_1)\n\n**\\[EDIT1\\]** I think the idea is the recycling is hyper optimal and also the water that is recycled is all drinkable. I just read some other article (which I closed out of) which mentioned the water tastes like bottled water, although it came from urine.\n\nAlso /u/ubik2 just posted a good explanation of how the system kind of feeds into itself and how they can get around needing to ship up heavy water to the space station.\n\n>Since 2010, they‚Äôve also been using the Sabatier reaction. That consumes the hydrogen from electrolysis and the CO2 from breathing, producing methane and water (which can then go back into electrolysis). This means you don‚Äôt have to keep shipping up a bunch of water. Unfortunately, that reaction needs more H2 than it frees (to make the methane), so we still ship that up. Fortunately, hydrogen is very light.\n\nAs for \"where does the nitrogen come from\" which is necessary for the air, it seems like they ship that up there (couldn't find any magic processes that produce it).\n\n>One system is to have oxygen delivered from [Earth](https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/earth.htm) via spacecraft. This oxygen is stored in external tanks; similarly, these spacecraft deliver [nitrogen](https://science.howstuffworks.com/chemistry-channel.htm) gas, which makes the ISS air supply.\n\nFrom [https://science.howstuffworks.com/international-space-station2.htm](https://science.howstuffworks.com/international-space-station2.htm)\n\nBUT it seems like you don't actually need that for breathing. Super interesting!\n\n>Nitrogen, a gas that makes up 78 percent of breathable air on Earth, is inert and can therefore be safely stored onboard spacecraft. Despite its high concentration within ambient air, nitrogen serves no particular physiological benefit to humans and only serves to keep the Space Station pressure at 1 atmosphere (14.7 psia). Prior to extra vehicular activities (EVA or space walking), astronauts purge nitrogen from their blood supply to prevent decompression sickness (‚Äúthe bends‚Äù). It is neither important nor practical to reclaim this nitrogen.\n\nFrom: [https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/146558main\\_RecyclingEDA%28final%29%204\\_10\\_06.pdf](https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/146558main_RecyclingEDA%28final%29%204_10_06.pdf)\n\n**\\[EDIT3\\]** From /u/acorz on how often they fly out the resupplies (unchecked source but they mention that work at the [Johnson Space Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html) aka NASA).\n\n>We fly N2 and O2 tanks 2 or 3 times a year. We fly most of our water once a year on [HTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-II_Transfer_Vehicle). In 4 years, I've only seen small hydrogen tanks for a science experiments, not resupply.\n\n**\\[EDIT4\\]** /u/sharfpang has a really [awesome comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/b2505l/eli5_how_does_the_iss_never_run_out_of_fresh_air/eiso5j9/?context=3) explaining how the Sabatier process isn't actually *currently* used and that they do actually ship the water up. I'm actually not totally sure this is true but they sounded confident (and [this article](https://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/oct/HQ_10-275_Sabatier.html) suggests Sabatier is used). BUT their comment goes into detail with the potential problems that come out of the Sabatier process and some other cool science stuff, so it's worth checking out.\n\n**\\[EDIT5\\]** Just a funny tidbit in this research is the Russian side of the ISS doesn't actually use their urine in the recycling process, but the US side does. I feel like I read it in a more credible source, but here's just a [random article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/26/us-astronauts-recycled-urine-international-space-station) I Googled that says the same thing.\n\n**\\[EDIT6\\]** Alright back to business. So the plot thickens, /u/sharfpang sourced an [exchange thread](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/30269/does-iss-get-a-surplus-of-oxygen-or-water#comment90086_30269) comment that makes it sound like Sabatier was a \"success\" which was actually a failure they silently decommissioned."}

One eye is completely normal and painless. \n\nThis happened to me when I was driving the other day and I was worried I‚Äôd have to pull over on the highway, but when I closed one eye I was able to see with no pain sensation whatsoever with roughly the same amount of light radiation entering my üëÅ.\n\nI know it‚Äôs technically less light for my brain to process, less intense on the nerve signals firing but I couldn‚Äôt intuitively get to the bottom of this because the common person might assume having one eye open could be worse?", "assistant": "You have a blink reflex when exposed to bright light. Ideally, you're exposed to a light that's too bright and you squint or close your eyes to prevent any damage. \n\nYou might ask, \"Surely only closing one eye shouldn't help, since the open eye could still be damaged, right?\" And you'd be absolutely correct. This is a glitch of the human nervous system. \n\nEssentially, this glitch occurs because your brain registers bright light by adding together the amount of light received in both eyes. If one eye is closed, that eye is receiving the same amount of light, but the brain is only registering half of the original amount. \n\nFun fact, some people (Ze Frank is a notable example) don't have this glitch. You can (but don't, it's not good for your eyes) test this by shining a light in one of your eyes, blocking the light from getting to the other eye, and watching to see if your non-lit pupil constricts. Normal people's pupils will both constrict if one eye is exposed to bright light. In the case of Ze Frank and others, only the pupil receiving the light will constrict."}

I was not trying to soapbox, and i am sorry that it kind of came across that way, though it may be more of a discussion question than i originally thought it would be...\n\n**--Edit:** I was not originally clear enough in phrasing my question!\n\nThere are a few of you that really did take the question seriously, and earnestly answered, and i really do appreciate that, but in the end, the question that was being answered was not really the question that i was trying to ask!", "assistant": "Ok, I'll make an attempt to explain as if I'm explaining to a 5-year-old, although this is not the kind of question a 5-year-old would ask.\n\nA long time ago, a black man lived in a place where most of the people were white. He wanted to find a girlfriend who was black like him. A lot of people want to find girlfriends and boyfriends that look like them. He saw his white friends finding girlfriends who looked like them on a big website, Date.com. He signed up for it and started to search.\n\nHe searched and searched, but he couldn't find any black ladies close enough to him to date. Did black ladies not have computers, he wondered? \n\nAt the same time, in the same city, there was a black lady who wanted to look for a black boyfriend. She looked at Date.com, but on their front page, all she saw were a lot of pictures of white people. She thought, \"This website won't be able to help me find a black boyfriend,\" and she didn't sign up.\n\nThe black man didn't give up. He decided to make his own website, just for black people to find each other. When he did, the black lady who lived in his city saw an ad for it, and she thought, \"Now I'll be able to find a black boyfriend!\" and she signed up.\n\nFinally, they met, and were happy being boyfriend and girlfriend together."}

Credit and Debit transactions are handled by completely different systems.\n\nThe differences:\n\nIf you select the Credit option, the transaction is processed through Visa, Mastercard, or another major credit card brand as if it were a regular credit card (as in, a card with a revolving line of credit which is not attached to a bank account). The merchant doesn't know that this is a bank card and not a credit card. They get their money and pay a 1.5% - 3% fee on the transaction. The transaction is also subject to consumer protections regarding credit cards; the consumer is never liable for any more than $50 (every bank goes over and beyond by making the liability $0, even though they don't have to.)\n\nIf you select the Debit option the terminal is now an ATM and the transaction is handled by a debit processor (the logo is on the back of the card, examples include Star, Pulse, Nyce, Accel, and Maestro). It's treated as a debit withdrawal like if you were at an ATM (though, nowadays, the actual transaction is coded in a way that the bank knows that it's a retail transaction and not an ATM withdrawal). The merchant knows it's a bank card. They get their money and pay a 0.25% - 1.5% fee on the transaction.\n\nThe big differences here:\n\nCredit:\n\n* Accepted just about everywhere.\n* Transaction fee is more expensive for the merchant.\n* The money may not be debited from your account for a day or two in some cases.\n* Consumer protection laws exist.\n* May or may not be secured with a PIN (this is up to the bank and the retailer in the US).\n* Does not allow 'Cash Back' transactions. (This is a policy thing. Some merchants can just manually charge a larger amount and hand you the difference.)\n* My bank lets me accrue points on Credit transactions.\n\nDebit:\n\n* Accepted in a many places but certainly not the level of ubiquity you see with Credit.\n* Transaction fee is cheaper for the merchant.\n* The money is immediately debited from your account at the time of the purchase. Debit holds for pre-authorized fuel purchases last only minutes, not days as with credit.\n* The consumer protection laws on debit transactions are minimal. Most banks will protect you but, to be clear, they are not required to by law.\n* Always secured with a PIN. The debit protocol requires a PIN for every transaction, no exceptions.\n* Generally allows cash-back as an option on the terminal. The merchant is allowed to turn this feature off.\n* My bank does NOT let me accrue points on Debit transactions.\n\nEdit:\n\nIn my attempt at being a know-it-all, it seems like I latched onto the wrong part of the post. As far as my attempt at answering as to why it's necessary to prompt for the type of transaction rather than asking the card about the transaction, I don't know the answer.\n\nMy working theory, however, and this is just speculation, is that the card doesn't indicate what types of transactions are supported. If you attempt to run the wrong type of transaction, the transaction is declined and a transaction fee is accrued by the mechant. The next best thing to do is ask what type of transaction to try before attempting to run it.\n\nSome banks DO use a standardized subset of card number prefixes exclusively for debit. (This is the first four numbers of the card number.) This is how some terminals can figure out that a card has debit transaction capability."}

I mean if both of those diseases are involving issues with breathing how come oxygen tanks aren't able to keep the people alive?", "assistant": "Hi, I'm a paramedic educator. I've been with a lot of people when this finally happened to them, and I often get to know people on a first name basis for years before it does. Let me try to explain.\n\nOxygen can keep you alive for some time. The problem is that you need to be able to take up enough oxygen into your bloodstream, and to remove enough carbon dioxide, to *at least* meet the minimum metabolic requirements of your body. If you ever run out of oxygen to provide an energy source for metabolism, that is one of the things that can cause death.\n\nCOPD and its related disease are progressive and irreversible - they will always grow worse with time, and the damage cannot be repaired. Eventually, your lungs can‚Äôt take up enough oxygen to keep you alive under any circumstances, they‚Äôre just not good enough to do the job. Then, you die.\n\nReal life is a bit more complex, obviously. If you have COPD because you're a lifelong smoker, there's a good chance that you never actually quit smoking and so you can never be given oxygen therapy because of the risk of fire. In some people it's not even really the oxygen that's the only major problem but also your inability to remove carbon dioxide, which becomes an anaesthetic when the levels in your body rise too much until eventually you become unconscious and stop breathing - like can happen in very severe asthma. One other really common issue is that you develop a chest infection, which both increases how much energy your body needs to stay alive *and* makes your lungs even worse at exchanging those two important gases, a perfect storm of problems.\n\nIn medicine, we can never predict precisely when or how someone will die but we *are* pretty good at knowing what's inevitable. Almost nobody with COPD dies on 100% oxygen flowing through a pressurised mask because we are very good at seeing the futility of that treatment beforehand. Rather, almost everyone who develops COPD and lives in a mature health system will go through a de-escalation of care in their last few days, with oxygen being mostly withdrawn or at least not escalated, and simply given comfort measures to make their death as pleasant and humane as possible. This is because of the first thing I mentioned in this comment - the diseases are progressive and irreversible, which makes them predictable.\n\nI hope this helps."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: What do all the characters in a URL mean?\n\nA URL will be something like YouTube.com/r7@usq=616UUhF\n\nWhat is all the jargon at the end?\n\nThanks in advance", "assistant": "It would have been a lot better if you just copy pasted a real YouTube URL, because that‚Äôs not what it looks like.\n\nThe first part of the URL, before the `://`, is the protocol, which determines how you are communicating with the server and what the data being sent means. For websites, it‚Äôs http (hypertext transfer protocol) or, for most modern sites, the encrypted https. But other protocols exist, like ftp (file transfer protocol), and other types of programs like databases use urls that start with, for example, `mysql://`.\n\nThe next parts of the url are `subdomain.domain.tld` where tld stands for top level domain. You kind of read this part backwards, actually, since the tld is the biggest category and the subdomain is the most specific category. This basically says which server you‚Äôre communicating with.\n\nAfter the domain is whatever is after the slash `/` which is the path. It‚Äôs essentially the server‚Äôs responsibility to decide what to do with the path, but this often specifies the specific page on the server that you want to see. This is optional, and if you omit it, the server will just serve you the ‚Äúroot‚Äù page.\n\nThen another optional part comes after a question mark `?`. This is the query, which is a standard way of giving the site specific extra parameters. The parameters are written as `name=value` and separated by ampersands `&`. This is extra information that is processed by the server. Some pages have required query parameters, and will give you an error if any are missing, but that‚Äôs all up to the server software.\n\nFor YouTube, the most common query parameter is `v` which stands for the video ID. So you might see a query like `?v=3MKpDA56-LivQKhH` which means ‚Äúshow the video with the ID ‚Äú3MKpDA56-LivQKhH‚Äù. The video ID is basically just a random sequence of characters chosen by YouTube to uniquely identify the video (if they just used the title of the video, it could be too long, many videos could have the same title, the title could contain bad words or characters that some users‚Äô computers don‚Äôt support etc., so it‚Äôs best for the server to choose its own random, unique identifier).\n\nOther parts of the query could tell the server how you got to the site. A link posted to social media might have `referrer=twitter.com` for example, so that when a user clicks that link, the server knows you came there from Twitter. And yes, it‚Äôs called Twitter.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs basically it. There‚Äôs also the `#` but that‚Äôs less commonly used these days."}

Its able to smooth out the output and give you a good idea of the real level.\n\nFloat and reed switch is essentially a float with a magnet it in that rides up and down a vertical shaft with the fuel level. As the magnet in the float passes reed switches at various levels on the vertical shaft, they become triggered.\n\nEdit as requested: A float and reed switch assembly is essentially foam donut with a magnet inside of it. That foam donut rides up and down on a vertical shaft inside the tank as the fluid level rises and falls. Inside the vertical shaft is a switch technology called reed switches. These reed switches either make or break an electrical connection - they are actuated magnetically by the float as it passes by. Hope that helps clear it up for those still confused.\n\nEdit: a word.\n\nTo be clear, this is ONE form of technology. There is also a Resistive sensor that functions like the float switch in the back of your toilet - as float rises, it rotates a sensor that changes the resistance value.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nLast edit: Suppose I should take the moment to shamelessly plug my company.

Next time my boss gives me crap about cruising reddit.......\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more edit: Common question - how does ultrasonics work?\n\nUltrasonic operating principal is all based on TOF (Time of flight). Ultrasonics generate a sound wave (by hitting a ceramic disc with a crap ton of voltage causing it to vibrate). Sound wave bounce off the surface of the fuel and returns to sensor face. As Speed of Sound (SoS) is a fixed value, you can tell how far away the fuel is (level) based on how long the sound wave took to get back to the sensor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast edit, PROMISE: As many have pointed out, float on a swing arm + resistive (like a potentiometer) is the dominant solution in the passenger car world - Ive worked most recently with on-road tractors (semi-trucks) which use much larger fuel tanks that would destroy the little mechanical float arm. This is why they use reed switchs + float vs what on-road cars use."}

Gravity is just acceleration, so there are two ways to make fake gravity: spinning and linear acceleration. Linear acceleration doesn't work because it needs you to keep your engine on so any long term form of artificial gravity will be spin based. The problem is that centrifugal force is velocity divided by radius squared, so for small radii, the difference in gravitational strength between your head and feet would be enough that your brain would get really unhappy.

Why cold affects the whole body & how?", "assistant": "Cold as in \"the body getting cold\" or cold as in \"have a viral infection from one of the many cold viruses\"?\n\nIn the case of your body getting cold, your cells need energy all the time. And as a part of that process they use tiny protein biocatalysts that allow the body to do many types of chemical reactions a lot more efficiently. However, in mammals those biocatalysts have been selected to be optimal for a very narrow temperature range (much narrower than the proteins in fish or other cold-blooded animals). This allows them to be very optimized and efficient for their task, but they start to work a lot worse if body temperature drops even a few degrees. So you get less energy and become very sluggish as your muscles are starved for energy.\n\nIn the case of a viral infection, as a response to infection the body (brain and hormone glands) ramp up the production of certain hormones called cytokines. These signals other parts of the body to put more energy into producing immune cells and raising body temperature to a fever (fever also relates to biocatalysts. Many infections have trouble performing the chemical reactions that they need if temperature rises even a single degree above normal human temperature).

It's easy to intuitively think of raindrops hitting small organisms as being equivalent to cinder blocks falling from the sky and hitting us, but that's not how it plays out.\n\n[Raindrops are not moving very fast, nor are they heavy](http://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2013/09/10/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall/).  For a raindrop to be considered a raindrop it has to be between roughly .5mm - 6mm (about the size of a fly at the largest).  A big raindrop has a terminal velocity of about 10 m/s (20 mph), with smaller drops down closer to 0.9 m/s (2 mph).  That's basically to say that there isn't much energy in any given raindrop to do a lot of damage with.\n\nAnother part is that smaller creatures are quite strong and tough as a result of the [Square-cube Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law).  This is why an ant or a spider is proportionally so strong and an element of this is why a mouse generally won't fall fast enough to get seriously injured whereas a horse or an elephant will splash from a long fall.  Also why a raindrop falling on a shrew or a butterfly isn't the equivalent of a cinder-block falling on a human.\n\nRaindrops can certainly hinder small organisms, but that tends to be more an issue of surface tension, heat loss, splashing and water flow, and things like that rather than the actual impact of the water droplet.\n\nFor many flying organisms *fog* (and, to a certain degree, drizzle) is actually  much more difficult thing to deal with as the tiny water droplets are suspended in the air and they accumulate on the surface of the flying organism, adding a lot of weight.

Use it instead of your debit card for daily purchases, and then immediately pay off your credit card. All those transactions are now credit building. Live this way for a year and your score will improve.\n\nAs long as you pay it off every month, you‚Äôll never pay interest, and you‚Äôll probably accrue benefits.\n\nAnother thing you can do is take out a personal loan from a credit union, and keep the money in a savings account and just pay it back with double payments every month. You‚Äôll have to pay the interest out of pocket (minus whatever your savings account pays) but it could be worth it to build the credit. If you put some of it in a short term CD, you call offset some of that interest cost."}

There are many roads which have the same name. Where do you start?", "assistant": "I grew up in Ye Olde Times (late 1990‚Äôs) when you needed paper maps to get around. \n\nFor local travel I had a little pocket London A to Z, which is a pretty neat little book that has every road, side street, ally, footpath, park, etc [mapped in surprising detail](https://cdn.notonthehighstreet.com/system/product_images/images/002/181/271/original_az-canvas-map-london.jpg), with a fairly easy to use lookup table, that took up half the book due to the vast number of streets. Want to go somewhere local that‚Äôs new you pull it out, find your destination, and work out what roads make the most sense to go there. There was more mental effort involved, which IME reinforced learning the route so you remembered it much better the next time you needed to go.\n\nFor intercity travel you could buy a larger book that went in your car, this was often an A3/11x17 (ish) size, it had a less extensive lookup table, but mapped most larger streets (albeit in not as much detail) but often stopped at a detail level that left the small streets off/unnamed. This would get you from city to city, and once within cities would get you to your destination, but you might have to hunt around on the page for a bit to find it if it wasn‚Äôt a major landmark. You could buy these in almost every petrol station in the UK. For other larger cities you could also get local A to Z that mapped everything in high detail."}

I posted this question (exactly as dictated to me) from a friend (who is not on social media) and for whom this was becoming a continuous source of argument between us. Apparently I did a terrible job trying to explain the limits of the 14th amendment. Your explanations were much better. \n\n\nI genuinely want to understand this and I am hopeful someone with knowledge of constitutional law background can explain to me why healthcare corporations that make business decisions profitable for shareholders but detrimental to their product/service/customers, aren‚Äôt seen as violating individual rights under the 14th amendment. I saw a press release about BCBS of Connecticut deciding not to pay anesthesia bills if the length of surgery exceeds what they think is appropriate. https://www.asahq.org/about-asa/newsroom/news-releases/2024/11/anthem-blue-cross-blue-shield-will-not-pay-complete-duration-of-anesthesia-for-surgical-procedures\n\nIf you‚Äôre in a bad car wreck and have to go to emergency surgery- how is a surgeon supposed to know how long it will take (much less the health plan?!) It seems to me that the mandate to make shareholders as much money as possible is taking priority of delivery of an adequate health benefit to individuals. Should that be a violation of the 14th amendment right to life‚Ä¶.??", "assistant": "First, the 14th amendment applies to actions by \"the state\" meaning the government, not to private companies. It is similar to the idea that the 1st amendment prevents the government from restricting many kinds of speech and exercise of religion, but private companies and individuals can do so within their scope of authority. A social media company can restrict political speech, people can prohibit the exercise of certain religions in their home, etc. The 14th amendment simply doesn't apply to the decisions of a business.\n\nSecond, the phrase \"without due process of law\" carries a lot of weight. Everyone has equal protection of the law so why are you allowed to live in the home you bought, but other random people cannot? Isn't that unequal treatment? Well yes, of course it is unequal treatment but it is justified by the fact that you purchased your home. That is \"due process of law\", and it also means that when shareholders buy ownership of a company they can reasonably expect that company to act in their interests over those of everyone else in the world.\n\nAs for your specific question about that insurance company's decision, there is no law that requires companies to produce good products. If a company wants to make a worse product that makes their shareholders more money then that is perfectly legal (as long as they are following other laws like not causing harm or being deceptive, etc). The 14th amendment doesn't force everyone in society to be egalitarian philanthropists."}

Thanks!", "assistant": "There are two things they do to make sure to not capsize. The first is to add ballast to the keel. In the age of sail they would add rocks or lead in the keel but for a well designed cruise ship it is enough to just place all the heavy machinery, fuel tanks, water tanks, sewage tanks, store rooms, etc. in the bottom of the ship. Similarly they make sure that the upper decks are fairly light weight. This all helps bring the center of gravity down as low as possible.\n\nSecondly they make sure the bottom of the ship is very wide. This makes the hull act more like a catamaran. As the ship heals over they will gain a lot of buoyancy on the side they lean towards because that becomes the deepest part of their hull. That buoyancy lifts the ship up on an even keel again."}

Skydiving works much like \"visual flight rules\" (VFR) where operators are expected to be able to see where they are going at all times. Skydivers don't really even have the option of navigating via instruments like an aircraft might, so entering a cloud would prevent them seeing and avoiding problems.\n\nPerhaps more importantly it also prevents **other aircraft** from seeing them and avoiding them as well! Suppose a skydiver falls through a cloud and suddenly pops out of the bottom right in the path of an approaching airplane. If they had avoided the cloud they would have been able to see the skydiver sooner and turned away. Think about it like avoiding the creation of blind corners when driving, it reduces the potential for accidents if making yourself hidden is not allowed."}

Is it simply the food companies greed that keep them putting crap in the food to increase their margins, or is there more at play?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for learning me on GMOs. TIL GMOs aren't bad", "assistant": "Well, GMOs aren't necessarily harmful from a nutrition standpoint (although the economic and environmental impacts are certainly debatable). Further, \"all natural\" isn't a protected term. That means any company can call their shit all natural and no one can contest it. Terms like \"organic\" and \"free range\" have certifications and standards which must be met in order to legally use the terms. As far as actual harmful processes and ingredients, yes, it is sometimes to cut costs. Other times, those ingredients are essential to the appearance, texture, and taste of the end product. Take microbeads for example (those little grainy bits that are in some exfoliating scrubs and body washes). They're in those products because they create that abrasive cleaning feeling (even though their functionality is dubious at best), and these beads end up getting flushed into the ocean and cause some serious ecological harm. \n\ntl;dr party because $$$ partly because we as consumers like it and buy it."}

I commute to work via bus and, every day, hordes of elderly Chinese men and women push and shove their way onto the bus in front of me. Usually I've waited a half hour, by myself, for the bus. At the last possible minute, a flood of geriatric Chinese men and women outflank me, ignoring my patient resolve as the first in line. I stand agape as they elbow their way in front of me--dragging their wheeled baskets over my toes. Once on the bus, their behavior continues to mystify: they run to fill the best seats; however, once those are full, they stand around the doors, refusing to budge for people entering or exiting the bus. When I shove my way past them--mirroring their own behavior--they complain loudly. I see \"gweilo\" in their beady, little eyes when they moan and cry out in mock pain as I push my way past their unmoving bodies so that I can get off the damn bus before I'm swept along to Chinatown with them.\n\nI think these people are horrible, so, clearly, I'm lacking some cultural empathy. Will someone please Explain to Me Like I'm 5 why elderly Chinese people act this way.\n\nMy theories:\n\n1. Cities in China are massively overpopulated.

Old Chinese people are just fucking, stupid assholes. I should treat them as such. Instead of tiptoeing around them and feeling bad, I should scream and slap them into submission--because that's the treatment they're expecting.\n\nI don't care if I carry the national debt in downvotes...writing this was cathartic.", "assistant": "I've been told, but I can't verify, that the sort of polite things we're taught in American culture are just not part of the etiquette in China. Holding doors for people and getting out of the way are just cultural etiquettes taught to us that people in China just aren't taught growing up. In some ways, there's a moral aspect to it, like everyone should try to be nice to everyone else, but in other ways, cultural stuff like this is just arbitrary. Every culture perceives certain things as rude and others as polite, and a lot of it is just random and arbitrary, like whether you should take your shoes off on the carpet, chewing with your mouth closed, burping, etc.\n\nAlso, etiquette involves a certain amount of trust in the people around you. There's no sense being polite and sensitive if everyone around you is rude and indifferent. So maybe in China, anyone who tries to be nice quickly gets discouraged when they see how everyone just walks all over them instead of appreciating their kindness, compounding the problem."}

It's just that something is somehow interacting with the quantum object, which forces it into a definite state. And this interaction is in many cases changing the property.\n\nIt's a bit like a coin flip. As long as it is in the air, you don't know what it will show (only the probability). As soon as it hits the ground (the interaction/the \"observation\"), it will either show head or tails and you have a definite answer (a definite state).\n\nAs long as a quantum particle \"is in the air\" it can show properties that a similar to classical waves (like making interference patterns). But after the interaction (after it landed) it's state is decided and it behaves more like a classical particle.\n\nBut actually it is neither of these. It is an quantum object that is its own category.\n\nOne of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics is that every measurement of a property of a particle requires an interaction, and these can change the properties of the particle in an irreversible way."}

This is incredibly interesting!", "assistant": "Physics and cost.\n\nThe theoretical efficiency limit is 95%. This is solely determined by the temperature of the sun and the temperature of earth. Whatever you do, a higher efficiency is never possible.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of limitations. First, the solar panel has to *send out* light as well: the temperature of the panel is above absolute zero, so it emits heat. This brings it down to 86.8%. But that assumes that the incoming light comes from every direction at once. In practice, the sun only covers a small part of the sky, bringing it even further down to 68.7%. And that's still with a perfect solar cell! That assumes the cell is infinitely thick and has zero losses.\n\nIf we try to actually build cells, the best we can currently do is around 44.4%, which isn't too bad! But those cells consist of multiple layers, use exotic materials, and are very expensive to construct. It is *way* cheaper to construct less complicated cells. Turns out we don't really care about the absolute efficiency: there is plenty of sunlight available. We just want the most power at the lowest cost.\n\nThe most common (and cheapest) cell type is \"single-junction\". The theoretical efficiency limit for those is 33.16%. Then we have some losses due to the protective coating, the wiring, being unable to cover 100% of the panel with cells, and loooots of other small stuff.\n\nSo yeah, it might not sound like much, but an efficiency in the 20ish% isn't too bad.

Anything in the lower half of LEO gets the bonus of trace atmospheric gasses clearing away the untrackable small debris.\n\nShielding is rare. Kevlar can be used (Bigelow inflatable nodes) but offers similar protection as solid aluminum. Most satellites use a type of corrugated aluminum for weight reduction. Other faults are far more likely, so redundancy of subsystems is going to afford you some level of insurance against strikes. \n\nHonestly, it's mostly statistics. Low altitude is self- clearing, higher altitudes see fewer highly elliptical paths that would introduce debris traveling at high relative speeds (i.e. most things that go up to MEO or GEO don't release debris/ travel with low relative relative velocity with the other satellites)\n\nThat's largely just for micro debris. Anything sizeable is tracked and avoided."}

In most other sports I've watched, like hockey or soccer, obviously there's some strategy, but I get the sense that the players make decisions in the moment (ex: A has the ball and passes it to B because B is open). But with plays, it seems like they make the decisions about how to pass the ball and whatnot ahead of time, and that this is secret to keep the other team from knowing about it. But how does deciding the actions ahead of time work, if you don't know what the other team is planning to do? Why is a certain play effective over a different one?", "assistant": "The goal of the offense is to at least gain 10 yards in 4 tries (downs). Offense is roughly split into three types of plays: passes, runs, and kicks. Each serves a few functions:  \n- **Passes** are generally attempts at gaining greater yardage. They also control the pace of play more, as incomplete passes cause the game clock to pause. (To varying degrees.)  \n- **Runs** are generally attempts at gaining lesser but easier yards. They allow the game clock to continue running.  \n- **Kicks** are usually performed on 4th down when the offense lacks the confidence or position to attempt another pass or run. A *punt* relinquishes the ball to the opponent, a *field goal attempt* tries to score a minimal amount of points.  \nThe offense will mix between different passes and different runs in an attempt to mislead the defense.  \n\nDefenses are set up as schemes to cover some amount of area on the field or specific players on the offense. It's a guessing game; if the defense can predict what type of play the offense will perform, they have a greater chance of nullifying it. They use logic systems to make these guesses; for example, running plays are often performed on 1st down in an attempt to gain easy yardage and make further downs shorter. The more diverse and athletic an offense's threats, the harder it is for the defense to predict and protect all portions of the field.  \n\nDifferent offensive plays will have advantages based on the quality of offensive players, the quality of defensive players, the ability to outthink the opponent, and the particular strengths of the team as a whole. For example, an offense with faster players might want to run the ball toward the sidelines hoping to outpace the defense, while a more muscular offense might want to run the ball right up the middle, relying on their strength to move tacklers out of the way."}

Will you love her/him, comfort her/him, honor, and keep her/him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, be faithful to her/him as long as you both shall live?\n\nAs you can see from the context, it's all about living together with your spouse and being faithful to them; but obviously, that only applies if you're both still alive.

Basically no one wants a pay cut and gets angry if you give them one but if there's slow inflation then over time if you do nothing it reduces pay and if you give them a small raise it can feel like they're moving forward when really they're staying in the same place.\n\nAnother factor when talking about cost of living is that the housing market is most developed countries is completely broken by regulation / zoning. In the mid 20th century it was fashionable to want to build enough houses for everyone. In the late 20th century there was a backlash against that and almost all housing got stopped almost everywhere.\n\nThis means as population grows faster than housing supply the cost of houses goes up over time which is one of the biggest contributors to the cost of living."}

The technology is quite similar to modern touch screen technology which is only able to detect fingers but not gloves. Wood is usually too dry for the sensors to trigger and the metal is too small for it to trigger. This is of course something the designers have to take into consideration. Possibly the hardest thing you can put in them is soaking wet wood for example if you are sawing raw lumber out in the rain but they have apparently been able to set the sensors to handle this as well. However as the SawStop patent is about to expire and competing products have already been shown to the market as being much cheaper to trigger there might be some advantage to triggering on metal as well protecting the blade."}

I'm not sure why holding out your arms for hours would kill you.\nHow does this process happen? How do we know what stress positions are? And how long can you hold one before hurting yourself?", "assistant": "Hi. Paramedic educator here. Every comment here is at best half-right, some of them are entirely wrong. Crucifixion kills you by [suspension trauma](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2658225/). This is very different to all of the other causes listed by other people here.\n\nSuspension trauma is caused by your body hanging or being pinned motionless in an upright position for a long period. Your body relies on muscle tone and movement in your legs to return blood to the heart. When you can‚Äôt - you‚Äôve been nailed to a tree - blood pools in the legs, pelvis and abdomen until none is returning to the heart, and your heart stops. Even before that point your blood pressure will drop, causing you to faint (called ‚Äúsyncope‚Äù), which can speed up the process by causing your airway to close and leading to sudden suffocation.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n> In a patient in vertical position, venous pooling occurs in the leg vessels due to gravity, which can lead to a 20% loss of circulating volume and a relative hypovolaemia. If the individual is then also immobile, there will be no muscle pump to provide venous return, with a reduction in cerebral perfusion leading to cerebral hypoxia. When the individual faints and assumes a horizontal position, there is an improvement in venous return and immediate recovery of consciousness.\n\nSuspension trauma still occurs today, such as in people who fall from heights but are saved by a harness. Left there to hang without rescue for too long, they can still die.\n\nEdit: a user asked a really good question about why this doesn't occur during general anaesthesia, and then I think they deleted their comment because I can't actually see it anymore - only in my notifications. Anyway, it's a good question.\n\nThe major difference is that general anaesthesia is almost never performed in a standing, upright position. When you‚Äôre lying down, blood can return passively to the heart without great difficulty. It‚Äôs still not ideal, but this isn‚Äôt one of the reasons why people die under anaesthesia."}

I‚Äôve always heard the phrase ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink the water in Mexico‚Äù, but never the same for Canada. Why is that? Is it the way the countries treat their water? Are there specific things that Mexico excludes that makes it dangerous but Canada includes because it coincides with the US treatment?", "assistant": "One of the issues is population density. Water which flows from a mountain is generally clean. Most of the pathogen that is harmful to humans come from human excrement. So when people live near the river they will most likely pollute it making it unsafe to drink. Some pathogens do also contaminate between humans and animals, these are mostly found in animals that have close contact with humans. So farms are another major source of contaminated water. In Canada most of the rivers flow through largely unpopulated areas before they get to a relatively small area of farms and villages close to the ocean or great lakes. But in Mexico the rivers flow through large areas of farmland and passes through cities for most of their flow. Adding to this there is much more water in Canada then in Mexico, so the same amount of pollution from a farm or city would be much more diluted in Canada and not be so big of an issue.\n\nThe second reason is that Mexico is hot while Canada is cold. Pathogens breed much faster in hotter climates. So there is much more pathogens in general in Mexico then in Canada. That means that even if it is diluted heavily by the river water it is still an issue in Mexico. There are also some areas of Canada that gets very hot in the summer. But they also tend to get very cold in the winter. A lot of pathogens will die if it gets too cold. So they die off in the winter and then spends most of the short summer recovering their numbers.\n\nWhat I have been talking about now is untreated water. But it is related to treated water as well. The water treatment plants are not perfect and it costs more to make them better. So a Canadian water treatment plant which removes everything might not work well in Mexico because there is a lot more to remove. They need better water treatment plants, which are more expensive."}

The PSA I saw didn't allude to anything like that.", "assistant": "Reframe it: it's not that 'medication is treated like a poison', it's an ingested drug. Charcoal absorbs ingested drugs, in your digestive system. Cis people don't take HRT by mouth, it's produced by their organs and goes straight into their bloodstream. (...Actually as a cis woman with menstrual issues I DO take ethinylestradiol, so charcoal's a bad idea for me too, but that's not what you were asking.)"}

Did the government really set up a handshake agreement over $200 billion?", "assistant": "Maybe you should go to the source:  I've written 3 books about this starting in 1998 -- and all of these appear to be related to the same threads -- over 2 decades. \n\nHere's a free copy of the latest book, \"The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal & Free the Net\", which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick\nhttp://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/\n\nI've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history \"The Unauthorized Bio\" with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released \"$200 Billion Broadband Scandal\" in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't.\nI updated the book in 2015 \"The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net\", but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting. \n\nWe paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion. \n\nFinally, I note. These are not \"ISPs\"; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location). \n\nIt's time to take them to court. period. We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations."}

You could attempt to do a broad, catch-all study that tries to include the most useful parameters, but then you run into resolution and field of view issues (making it a poorer quality study). Full body MRI is actually offered as a boutique pay-out-of-pocket service in certain countries, but it often creates more questions than it answers, and the patient likely would have to go back to re-image the body part in question just to get the right sequences and evaluate it properly. All of which may end up in it being something totally medically irrelevant or incidental.

To all the people being mad for no reason, have a day off for once.", "assistant": "I know this! Im a scientist at a pharmaceutical company and im responsible for formulating and pilot batch manufacturing of tablets. The reason is due to the allowable errors in tablet weight and size;\n\nIt all comes down to the equipment used, mainly the tablet punch (like a mould) that compresses powders into a tablet. The industry standard is usually an oblong shape with a break-line down the middle, and the thickness can be controlled to give the required tablet weight, usually 1 gram.  The weight is the important bit, as we can control the weight to a certain extent as powder flow and particle size can differ from batch to batch. Some tablets may be a tiny bit heavier or a bit lighter than the one before it as it is ejected from the tablet pressing machine.\n\nWhile it would seem cheaper to use smaller tablets and cut down on filling material, it would be a lot harder to control the tablet weight. Usually the average tablet weight is not allowed to deviate by more than 5% of the labelled amount (as per FDA guidelines). This means that for a 1g tablet we are allowed to have tablets differing in weight by 50mg (5% of 1 gram). A standard tablet press is able to meet these standards and create tablets that stay within the 50mg weight limit.\n\nNow, if we had a tiny tablet, say 0.1 grams (baby aspirin springs to mind), then we would have to control the weight to the nearest 5mg (5% of 0.1 grams), which is tiny and almost impossible to meet. In this case we would have to use super expensive tablet punches on a very expensive and well calibrated tablet press.\n\nIts cheaper to just use a larger tablet and make the rest up with filler material. A previous user said we use chalk, thats not true. Usually we use a form of cellulose (micro-crystalline cellulose) that comes from the cell walls of plant material. Its totally organic, cheap, and low in sugar and carbohydrates.\n\nTLDR; Its easier to meet quality control standards when a tablet is big and the equipment used is cheaper. So a big tablet is always favoured regardless of if it could be made smaller.\n\nEdit: I re-read the post and this doesnt even answer OP's question! multivitamins almost always come in larger 1g tablets, so im not sure about small multivitamin tablets?\n\nEdit 2: just because supplements like vitamins aren‚Äôt fully regulated doesn‚Äôt mean companies slack off. Most reputable supplement/pharma companies will still apply the FDA guidelines to their products wether it‚Äôs necessary or not. It ensures quality and lowers risk to the end user (I.e. expensive lawsuits or product recalls). Our internal QC is standardised to meet FDA approval regardless of the product."}

I have a PhD in biochemistry and sometimes my colleagues and I get confused about which definition to use in which situation, so you aren‚Äôt stupid to be confused. It‚Äôs complicated.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the ELI5:\n\nWater is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen: H2O. But, oxygen can only hold on to one hydrogen strongly at a time. The other one is bouncing on and off constantly. Chemists write that as H2O <-> H + OH. This is normal and is happening all the time.\n\nWhen there are other chemicals in the water, sometimes you end up with more H than OH, or more OH than H. If you have more H than OH, we say it‚Äôs acidic, and if you have more OH than H, we say it‚Äôs basic or alkaline. \n\nFor example, citric acid like you find in fruit will start releasing H if it‚Äôs in neutral water, making it more acidic. Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is a base and does not release OH, but rather collects free H floating around in solution, tilting the balance toward more OH.\n\nConfusingly, sometimes acids will accept free H under the right conditions, and bases will release them! In this context, they are referred to as buffers, as they resist change in pH. How they behave depends a lot in what environment they are in."}

One of the things they teach you is that an object sitting on a table is applying force to the table, and the table is applying an equal force to the object, just in the opposite direction. This does not require any energy input. No work is being done.\n\nMagnets are similar. They apply a force on each other that is similar to the force of gravity, only with a different type of field (2 poles). They'll seek the lowest energy state, which is where the opposite poles are together. It requires energy to pull them apart, just like it requires energy to lift the object off the table."}

Way back in the day it was more likely you'd hear about countries long before meeting anyone from there or learning anything about them. So essentially you'd hear about some distant land's name through a telephone game spanning thousands of miles. \n\nAs an example, Japan calls Cuba \"kyu-ba\" like an American would and not \"ku-ba\" as it's called by its current inhabitants because they first learned about it (on a wide enough scale) from English speakers. Conversely they call Germany \"Deutsch\" because of their trade relations with Holland which is also what they still refer to the Netherlands as.\n\nJapan was first learned about in the West from the Chinese -- who themselves have a unique name for the nation -- telling some Portuguese (I think) about this nothing island just off the Korean Peninsula, and it came out to something like \"Zipangu,\" which was then further bastardized to \"Japon\" and then an Englishman would read it off a sheet of paper before ever hearing someone say it, thus \"Japan.\"\n\nSo basically, it's all about history and how cultures learned about each other through various lines of communication where proper pronunciation is the least of people's concerns.

Your computer can flip these switches whenever or check which way they're flipped. They also stay flipped if you turn your computer off. You can store arbitrary information by flipping the switches in whatever pattern you want.\n\nNow because it's all just on and off switches, your computer can't exactly tell where one file starts and ends, so at the beginning of evert file there's a little bit of header data that says basically \"I'm a file that exists. I start at memory address A and end at memory address B.\"\n\nWhen you want to delete something, you now have two choices. You can either go and flip every single switch to \"off\" (which permanently deletes everything in that area of your hard drive forever), or you can take the faster option and just delete that tiny bit of header data. Without a header, the file becomes basically garbage - the data is still there for now, but the computer considers that space as empty.\n\nEventually, a new file will come along and overwrite that data. But, until that happens, a specialized program can come along and try to piece it back together (though the results are likely to be partially corrupted).\n\nAlso, if every single switch is marked as \"in use\" by your system, you don't have any leftover switches to write any new files.

Mature plants don't really have this ability anymore and thus use the angle of the light to \"decide\" where to grow.

In food allergies IgE antibodies are made, and when they bind to protein they recruit other immune cells to release histamine and cause an allergic reaction. Meanwhile, many people have IgG antibodies to food proteins, but those don‚Äôt trigger histamine release or allergic reactions so it doesn‚Äôt matter. This is actually how allergy shots work, they make the immune system switch from IgE to IgG antibodies so people stop having allergies. \n\nThe ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for this is complicated and not fully understood, it‚Äôs asking why allergies exist in the first place and why those proteins lead to them but not other proteins. IgE is normally part of our defense against parasites, for some reason those proteins are triggering our immune system to respond as if there is a worm/parasite (this is where the hygiene hypothesis etc. comes in). \n\nGluten is different. Celiacs is not an allergy, it‚Äôs a T cell mediated hypersensitivity reaction (in other words it‚Äôs a different part of the immune system and antibodies don‚Äôt play a major role).

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: Can amnesia make you forget mundane things?\n\nI know amnesia can make you forget memories of past events (like recent or childhood), past relationships, or even languages. But can someone forget random mundane things like, for example, trees, cars, or even the sky, etc.? I don't know how this would feel like.", "assistant": "I am not a neurologist, but have made some amateur study of neuropathology and the structure of the brain. Short answer: Alzheimer's can do this. Long answer below.\n\nThere are four effects that are relevant; short term amnesia, long term amnesia, local damage of other kinds, and diseases (I address Alzheimer's at the end.)\n\nShort term amnesia disrupts the brain's ability to encode new memories. The body perceives huge amounts of data constantly; all of it enters a super-short perception window (every color and shape in front of your eye), after which it is filtered down to what you are conscious of (sounds and letters), then down to short term memory (like winding back the last few seconds of what someone said, or reading and repeating a phone number), then slower filters boil it further into long term memory (fully memorizing the quote or phone number). Short term amnesia does not affect \"mundane\" things, unless they hadn't already been encoded, because it only affects new stuff.\n\nLong term amnesia (on its own) is, in my understanding, less common and more complex, but seems to degrade \"higher level\" memories much more than \"concept memories\". Reports of people forgetting events, people or complex knowledge; basically losing the connection between the small symbols that build up a big memory, rather than losing the symbols themselves. The more \"basic\" something is, the more engrained it is into many neural pathways (or even redundantly encoded), so the harder it is to forget. Especially because someone with long term amnesia can probably still encode new info, so as soon as they re-learn or partially remember something basic, there is a chance to repair the memory. \n\nThen there \"local\" damage. Some parts of the brain are responsible for certain things, such as muscle control, but most memory (AFAIK) is kind of stored all over the place, all at once. It's not like a CD, where a small scratch might only affect one song and leave the rest unaffected. It's more like a company of 100 people; take out one person and the company can still function, but it will loose *something*, it's just not clear what. Single neurons don't remember single facts, the arrangement of all the neurons encodes the facts. Technically, damaging just the right neurons can affect very low-level memories, but I think this is a very specialized case, and currently not well understood (but may be a reason for the effectiveness and danger of Electroconvulsive Therapy.) But, for the sake of completeness, I'm sure there are cases of people with brain damage that forget something extremely specific, I am unaware of them.\n\nFinally, there are diseases with specific effects. Rabies makes the victim hydrophobic; perhaps they forget that water is good, or perhaps something else is happening. And neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's affect increasingly basic functioning until the person passes away due to loosing critical functions entirely; you could say they \"forget how to breath\" but this isn't strictly accurate. But the victim could forget very basic ideas, like north/south, house=building, or the meaning of colors, in the late stages of Alzheimer's. My understanding is that this is highly distressing at worst, and passively confusing at best. However, it is not isolated; by the time an Alzheimer's patient forgets what the sky is, they have forgotten many, many things, and may not be able to communicate or even understand what they are missing. Remember that a missing memory is not like a black spot in your vision; it is beyond your vision, it is where you can't see. \n\nShoot. I forgot to mention schizophrenia, and how that can affect memories, especially those concerning the self. But that is also less relevant."}

Not everything needs to be copied though and sometimes it can be beneficial if all the copies had access to the same data; that's where static fields come into play. For example if I have a class of Smurfs, then each copy of a Smurf can be at a different place so I need to keep track of it. However, all Smurfs are blue, so there is no reason for each Smurf to keep track of its skin color - they have a shared / static skin color.\n\nWhat if you have a class but don't actually want multiple instances of it to exist? That's where singletons come into play, which use language features to make sure only one instance of a certain class can exist.

Both very much have their place.\n\nIf you want to mimic an application like you have at work, whether because you use it there, or because you have no lab there, you'd definitely want to do that.\n\nIf you want to learn about or dig deeper into OS management (including application installation and dependency management) something like a VM will make more sense. If you want to focus on application delivery, or even application level support, containers are certainly going to be a better solution for that. Some people run their worker nodes as VMs. Best of both worlds. Some things that aren't ephemeral, like databases and domain controllers, while they certainly can be run in a container, maybe it makes more sense those be VMs (or even bare metal if you have the lab capacity).\n\nEDIT: just realized im in ELI5\n\nA VM might be 40 GB and contain everything necessary to drive the OS.  \n\nA Docker container might be 400 MB and contain only what is necessary for the purpose it serves such as a single application.

I know that some power plants, like nuclear ones, can‚Äôt just be shut down. What do they do with the electricity they continue generating if it‚Äôs not being used?", "assistant": "The electric generator (think of it as a motor, but in reverse), is constantly spinning against the grid load applied to it (the demand), if demand suddenly drops, the resistance suddenly drops, and the generator is much more free to spin.\n\nHow the system responds is different in different cases but generally speaking if this happens to stop the generator from spinning itself to smithereens without the resistance from load to keep it spinning at eg. 50 Hz, such as an abrupt loss of transmission in a grid-wide blackout, it will instead shunt steam energy through a bypass where that load is shedded off to the environment as lost heat, and the eg. nuclear reactor will be brought down to a lower power state with control rods so less of this shedding has to occur. I believe they will shed as much as needed to keep the generator spinning at 50 Hz, even though it may be generating a fraction of the power it normally would - it would only have the demand load on it from the plant infrastructure itself and maybe some electrically based load shedding systems. This keeps the generator ready to reconnect to the grid when it is able to do so, by matching the needed grid frequency.\n\nThere isn't much actual energy storage in the form of electricity except in the case of battery banks, for the most part all electricity on the grid is consumed at the rate it is generated, at night the grid will power hydro pumps to bring water back up into hydroelectric reservoirs and things to work as gravity batteries, but in the case of a blackout where transmission isn't possible, that cannot happen."}

Are lips not as important as one would imagine?", "assistant": "This is really two different questions, so that's how I'm going to treat it. \n\n**First question: How do birds make human sounds when their bodies are so different?** \n\nThe answer is that birds rely on vocalizations, so they actually have a very diverse set of noises they can make. Birds sing and chirp and hoot to relay all kinds of information, the way we make different noises with our mouth to mean \"hello\" or \"danger\" etc. The [physiology of birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_\\(bird_anatomy\\)) allows them to make most of the same sounds as us--however, there are sounds that they can't make. [Listen closely to this](https://youtu.be/9y3VX8VU9kI?t=25s). The word \"pick\" actually comes out \"kick\", but because there's a subtitle and because pick makes more sense, your brain wants to hear pick. \n\nYou're right on the money with lips: the sounds birds have trouble making are the sounds that require lips. But they use substitutes that are close enough that we might not notice. For \"p\" you can substitute \"k\". For \"m\" you can substitute \"≈ã\" (the sound at the end of \"thing\"). Both of these sounds can be made without lips. Birds also tend to talk very very fast, which helps blur the words together enough that they sound right. \n\n**Second question: Why don't chimps have this ability?**\n\n[Chimpanzees communicate mainly by gestures and facial expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBFBbFcixRY). They do make noises, but they're not the most important part like they are for us. Chimps only have [four distinct noises](http://www.chimps-inc.org/chimpanzee-vocalizations/), \"grunts, barks, screams, and hoots\". The way they distinguish meaning from these is how loud they are and whether they're low or high pitched. So chimps don't need the phonetic range that a human or a bird has. They don't need their muscles to make the kind of complex sounds that humans use. Evolution made some changes to our anatomy that allow us to make a wide range of sounds, but chimps don't need that so they never developed it. \n\nIn addition, phonetic range is a very use-it-or-lose-it skill. [If a baby human is not made familiar with certain sounds, they will have a much harder time picking them up later in life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition#Sensitive_period). So even with the sounds a chimp might be physically capable of making, the chimp probably hasn't trained their muscles to make it and will struggle with it. \n\nBecause primates like chimps communicate through gesture, they have actually been very successful at learning sign language. But their voices are only used for grunting and hooting, so it takes a lot more work for them to use words. \n\n**TLDR: Birds normally communicate vocally, like we do. Chimps normally communicate through gesture. It's easier to teach birds how to make certain sounds and teach primates how to use sign language than the other way around. Also, birds make mistakes but our brains like to fix them.** \n\nEdit: I am young and dumb. I wrote this post during a break from studying for my finals. I expected maybe five people to read it. I'm trying to correct the mistakes as people bring them to my attention and I'm happy to do that but please remember that I'm not being wrong on purpose to make you mad and it's really upsetting to get PM's calling me a cunt."}

It‚Äôs like when you yell for your mommy outside a locked room, if she recognizes your voice, she will respond and unlock the door to let you in.  Voices can be similar, so if in the rare case some other kid sounds like you, she could be confused and let the wrong kid in.\n\nPhysical Identification is the cut key itself, or in the case of Push Button start, the physical proximity of the key.   When your mom opens the door, she would make sure you look like her child.  You have a unique face but doppelg√§ngers or your twin brother could fool her into thinking another kid is you.   \n\nEncrypted Identification is the RFID chip inside the key that the immobilizer has to sense to allow the car to run.   Even if you can duplicate the remote entry or physical key, the RFID reader will still need to read the encrypted code programmed to each key matches to the Immobilizer before the car is allowed to remain running for more than a few seconds.   This is extremely difficult to duplicate and very short range, so the real key would need to be within a few inches of the ignition to work.  It‚Äôs like your mom verifying your fingerprint or DNA to make sure you are you, even if you look and sound like her child."}

When something turns back into a liquid it releases heat.\n\nRefrigerators (and air conditioners, heat pumps, etc.) take advantage of it. They contain two coils and a mechanism to force the phase change to happen in a substance known as a refrigerant in particular places within the system. The system forces the refrigerant to evaporate inside the refigerator, pulling heat out of it, and then it transports it outside the refigerator and forces it to condense, releasing that heat out into the room. You can often see the condenser coils exposed on the back of the refrigerator. They will be warm/hot when the system is actively cooling."}

When Gareth Southgate was a player, he missed the 6th penalty vs Germany in Euro 96. He was a defender, and I don't believe he ever took a penalty as a club player. He was bound to fail. That said, he was the 6th player to make an effort when usually you only need 5.\n\nSome players just aim to place the ball in the far corner which is practically unsaveable by the keeper as they simply cannot reach the ball. This is the best approach in my mind, but does require very good accuracy as there is a risk of putting the ball wide.\n\nOthers will try to focus on the keeper and make him dive the wrong way. To do this, they wait for the keeper to move first and then slot the ball in the other direction. One difficulty with this is that the law says that the penalty taker must maintain forward momentum at all times. This is because players would stop during their run up in an attempt to make the keeper move first. This is not allowed as it is considered unfair.\n\nAnother tactic is to simply kick the ball as hard as possible and hope for the best, like Beckham did against Argentina. This tends to make the shot a little more central. This can work because most of the time the keeper will dive to either side. It would be a little weird for a keeper to simply not move.\n\nLast night we also saw another interesting tactic by Ivan Toney of England. He kept his eyes on the keeper all throughout his run up and shot, i.e. he didn't look at the ball for a second, and shot it \"blind\" so to speak. But apparently this is his system of doing it. Toney is one of the best penalty takers there is.\n\nAs for goal keepers ‚Äì often the keeper will be given a list by their coaching staff of which way to dive for each opposition taker.\n\nAlso, goalkeeping shithousery is a thing. Keepers will employ various tactics to put off the shot taker, although the keeper is not allowed to move util the ball is hit. Jordan Pickford of England is a master of this. He pulls faces, talks to the shot taker ad generally tries anything to disturb their concentration. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't\n\nLastly, I think confidence is a huge part of penalties."}

Men do not like talking about having prostate cancer, principally because even the treatment options attack masculinity.

So, a lot of people have mentioned attenuation (signal degradation) as well as background cosmic waves.\n\nThe waves would very much weaken, but it can travel a long wave before its degrades to a unreadable state. Voyager being able to recieve a signal so far out is proof that's its possible. Im sure someone who has a background in radiowaves will come along and explain (I'm only a small-time pilot, so my knowledge of waves is limited to terrestrial navigation).\n\nAs to cosmic background radiation, credit to lazydog at the bottom of the page, I'll repost his comment\n\n>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away."}

Are they supposed to be \"safer\" drivers then the rest of us?\n\nI have officers speed by me all the time going 15+ mph over the speed limit.", "assistant": "It depends on the circumstance.  If I'm just driving around on general patrol, I follow the speed limit.  If I'm going to back another officer up or trying to get to the scene of domestic, I will go over the speed limit without lights.  I don't do so in a reckless manner or in anyway that endangers other drivers.  Frankly, sometimes it's simpler to get by people without the lights on, people tend to freak out and make unsafe maneuvers in their vehicle when they see an emergency vehicle approaching.  With all that being said, I don't go over the speed in which I would ticket someone for.  For instance, I don't issue speeding tickets unless the driver is going in excess of 15 mph over the posted speed limit.  That's also not an automatic ticket, if they have some reasoning behind going that fast; I will often times just give them a warning.\n\nSome officers do speed in their personal vehicle because they know they can get away with it if they get pulled over.  I do not, if I'm in my personal vehicle I follow all laws very strictly; I feel it would be hypocritical for me to do otherwise.  \n\nAs far as illegally parking, it depends on the situation.  If I'm stopping somewhere for a reason other than business, I park in an appropriate spot.  If you seen me parked in no parking or a fire lane, it's because there's an emergency; or I'm there to take someone to jail.  You really don't want to have to walk a prisoner 200 yards through a grocery store parking lot.    \n\nI can't speak for other officers.  I know there's a lot of disdain for the police.  Depending on the officer and/or the department, it may be warranted.  I just hope you guys try to keep an open mind about each officer before you have reason to condemn them.

Normally, to make a person pass out, you need sufficient acceleration (around 4+ Gs or more), in the right axis (positive or \"downward,\" from head to tailbone), for enough time (at least a few seconds for high G, more time for less G).\n\nYet, the people on these rides are launched while on their backs, so the blood is not pulled from their brains.  The impulse is about 4 \"eyeball back\" Gs, which is a very different feeling than positive Gs. And it lasts just a couple of seconds before they go to zero Gs at the top of the arc, and then they tumble with pulses of positive, negative, and lateral Gs.\n\nI have ridden the slingshot, and it's very similar in feeling to a carrier catapult launch, which is about 5 eyeball back Gs for 2.5 seconds.  While exhilarating (and fun), it does not come close to causing a G-LOC; one could do it for minutes or more without any danger of passing out.\n\nOften, slingshot riders pass out instantly, as soon as the launch is triggered.  Often, they pass out and wake up repeatedly in all phases of the ride, during positive, negative,and lateral G.\n\nSo, is it G-LOC, or is there some fear-fainting component?  Fainting from something emotionally overwhelming used to be a common TV, cartoon, and movie trope, but does not seem to be so, anymore.  Similarly, there are plenty of videos of people getting jump-scared and convulsing or hopping around involuntarily, but no one faints.  Also, there are lots of people getting emotionally overwhelmed by being surprised by relatives, and there is shock and happy crying and sometimes leg-crumpling, but no fainting.\n\nSo, why do people pass out on the slingshot?  It shouldn't be the forces, and fear and shock don't seem to be enough to do it, alone.  Maybe a combination?", "assistant": "I would think it has more to do with a [vasovagal syncope](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527) response than G-LOC. \n\nYou‚Äôre probably spot on with the fear/stress induced response.

Now next year inflation is at 5% and your income follows so now you make 21k, and this year the no-tax bracket also gets increased by 2%: now you pay 20% on 21.000 ‚Äì 5.100 which amounts to 3.180 or 15,14% of your gross income, a small increase compared to last year. \n\nHere‚Äôs the few things I don‚Äôt understand: first of all, isn‚Äôt this just inflation and the reason why it can be bad, if all the rest stays equal? Shouldn‚Äôt the fact that in that scenario the no-tax bracket has been increased be seen just as the State trying to help lower incomes, rather than part of the cause for fiscal drag?\n\nAlso, even after a small increase in the tax % there‚Äôs still more money left after taxes, even adjusting expenses to inflation: let‚Äôs say in the first example one lives off 16k expenses and saves 1k, the next year he‚Äôd spend 16.8k but saves 1.020, as long as the income adjustment covers the expenses inflation there‚Äôs more money left over and even without any State intervention (adjusting no-tax bracket, even if just partially) there would be no difference, although I guess those same 1k left would have a lower spending power compared to the previous year, but again isn‚Äôt that just inflation?\n\nLastly, I know there‚Äôs a hole somewhere in the example where a step up in tax brackets occurs, so let‚Äôs say in that same scenario we had a tax increase after 20k to 22%, in that situation you would be left with 980 dollars rather than 1k, maybe that‚Äôs the actual situation where fiscal drag occurs?\n\nIf that‚Äôs the case, is there any solution to the problem?", "assistant": "The clearest example is in wages.\n\nIf wages go up 5% this year, but the starter brackets for income tax does not go up, you are now paying tax on a larger percentage of your income.\n\nThat's fiscal drag in a nutshell."}

Let‚Äôs assume that we‚Äôre talking about a public company you could buy shares in at any time, like Alphabet (they own YouTube). Let‚Äôs also assume you‚Äôre a really really rich person (not a public company yourself).\n\nWell, Alphabet is owned by thousands and thousands of people right now. You can absolutely go find all of the them and buy their shares from them one by one. That‚Äôs hard! There‚Äôs lots of them and you have to negotiate a price with everyone individually. There‚Äôs also lots of rules about trying to do this, so it‚Äôs really rare.\n\nSo what‚Äôs the next best thing? Well, you can make an announcement like ‚ÄúI have trillions of dollars. I will buy any share of Alphabet that anyone wants to sell for me $100/each, as long as you tell me by December 31st.‚Äù That‚Äôs makes sense, and if the share price is $50, lots of people will probably sell to you. But you‚Äôd probably only want to do this deal if almost everyone sells to you, right? You want the whole company. So, you‚Äôd actually say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy every share anyone wants to sell for $100, but you have to tell me by December 31, and I‚Äôll only buy them if at least 50% of all shares are sold to me then.‚Äù This is a real strategy, it‚Äôs called a tender offer, and it‚Äôs pretty simple legally speaking. Companies decide major things by asking for a majority vote of their shareholders. Once you own more than 50% of the shares, every time there‚Äôs a vote, you‚Äôd basically decide everything. You wouldn‚Äôt actually pick the CEO, you‚Äôd vote for members on the Board of Directors (you‚Äôd always decide who wins those elections), and they pick the CEO. You could be one of the directors though. \n\nYou might be thinking that‚Äôs a little complicated and it would be easier if you get to own 100% of the company right away and pick the CEO yourself. Is that possible? Yes! What you do here is go to the board of directors and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay $100 per share for every share, but I want them all‚Äù. If the board thinks that‚Äôs a good price, then they‚Äôll agree. In fact, they have to agree if it really is a good price. The risk is, they‚Äôll tell you they need to think about it and then call everyone they know and ask if someone else will pay $105. But let‚Äôs assume no on will. You‚Äôll sign an agreement with the board that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to buy all shares for $100.‚Äù But there‚Äôs lots of shareholders, remember? Well, the the rules are, if you offered to buy all the shares, and the board agrees it‚Äôs a good price, they will hold a vote and invite everybody who owns shares to vote whether to take it or not. Since it‚Äôs a good price and the board agrees, probably most people  will vote yes. If they do, then you will send $100 times the total number of shares to the company. The company will send $100 to each share. And then you own the company! You can still have a board if you want, but you don‚Äôt have to, and you can decide the CEO and decide anything else you want to as well. \n\nThere‚Äôs a special way you need to tell a company‚Äôs board you‚Äôll buy all the shares and they‚Äôre going to make you prove that you have enough money. Then there‚Äôs a very special way you need to put the money into the company. But you‚Äôre a trillionaire - you will pay lawyers and bankers to handle those details for you. This is the basic way that we say a ‚Äúbuyout‚Äù or a ‚Äútake private‚Äù transaction works. \n\nBy the way, maybe you want to pay everyone $100 but you only have $50. You can borrow the other $50 from banks and use $50 of debt and $50 of your own money to buy all the shares. Once you own the company, the company will repay the debt for you using money it makes from staying in business. Now you‚Äôre doing what we call a ‚Äúleveraged buyout‚Äù. Fun!"}

Why can't we just do that? The national debt would go down to $0, everyone that we owe money would get paid back, and it would cost us barely anything to do. I'm sure there's some problems with this, but I can't think of a single one.", "assistant": "First off all, the United States government can't print one cent worth of money. The only institution that can create money is the Federal Reserve Bank, and they're an independent institution which the US Government has no control over. President Obama can't tell the Federal Reserve what carpets they should use. All he can do is appoint the Governors, but what they do after that is their decision.\n\nCongress, on the other hand, can, because the Fed is technically under their jurisdiction. But they never, ever do. The reason for this in order for central banks to function, they have to be completely independent of the government that runs them. \n\nWhy do they have to be independent? Because, historically, when governments have been in charge of Central banks, very, very, *very* bad things have happened. The reason why you can't just print a trillion dollar bill is that when you create money from the central bank without actually increasing real output (i.e. the \"productiveness\" of a country, the GDP), it leads to inflation. When the government prints *lots and lots* of money, it can lead to *lots and lots* of inflation. And that is very, very bad. It's essentially what happened in all those countries where hyperinflation struck, and people had to cart money around in wheelbarrows to buy bread. \n\nThat said, the Federal Reserve for the last few years have been doing a version of this. They have done a so-called \"quantitative easing\" program where they have bought up massive amounts of Treasury bills, trillions of dollars worth. They did this as a way to massively inject money into the American economy to stimulate growth, but it also had the side effect of lowering the interest rate for US Government debt (since they increased demand for Treasuries), which means that right now, the US Government can borrow money for only a tiny amount of interest. \n\nWhy hasn't this lead to massive inflation, like I just described? Here's where we get into the weeds of economics, because different people have different answers to this. I personally find the Keynesian answer by far the most compelling, which is that the reason there's very low inflation is that we're in a so-called [liquidity trap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_trap).\n\nIn short: governments and central banks has to be independent of one another, because it's so much easier (and more tempting) for a government to simply print money rather than do hard stuff, like raising taxes or lowering spending. But if they do that, very bad things happen in the long run, which is why we have central banks. Their job is to keep the monetary base of a country sound (and the economy in good shape).\n\nEven shorter: Because inflation."}

Computer science student here. First time on this subreddit so I will try my best to explain it simply.\n\nImagine you have a water bucket. You can fill it up, store that water for a while, and then let it out all at once when you need it. A capacitor works kind of the same way, but instead of water, it stores electricity.\n\nIn a circuit, electricity does not always flow perfectly smoothly. It can come in little waves or bursts. Some parts of electronics, like computer chips or audio equipment, really do not like these bumps. A capacitor can soak up extra electricity when there is too much and release a bit when there is not enough, evening things out.\n\nThey are also used when something needs a quick punch of power, like a camera flash. The battery alone cannot release energy fast enough, so the capacitor stores it up and dumps it all at once to make the flash bright.\n\nAnother thing that capacitors are useful for is debouncing. Imagine you have a light switch that is a little bouncy. When you flip it, it does not just go click. It kind of rattles between on and off really fast for a fraction of a second before settling. Your eyes cannot see it, but electronics are way faster than you, so to them that tiny rattle looks like you pressed the button five or six times instead of once.\n\nA capacitor can help calm things down. When you connect it in the right place, it acts like a tiny shock absorber for electricity. Instead of seeing a bunch of rapid on-off-on-off signals, the circuit sees one clean, smooth press. It is like giving your bouncy switch a little cushion so it stops jittering immediately.\n\nWithout capacitors, a lot of electronics would flicker, glitch, or just not work the way we expect."}

What‚Äôs the deal?", "assistant": "Skin: \n\nYour skin is fairly smooth, and is waterproof. When you draw on your arm in marker, the ink is carried from the tip to your skin by a solvent, like propyl alcohol, this solvent quickly dries. The solvent isn't water, so it penetrates more deeply into the keratinized layer of skin. This leaves the ink on the top of your skin, and a little will get INSIDE your skin (I'm talking in microns) this is why when you wash it off, most of it, the stuff on the surface, comes off fairly easily. It isn't water soluble, so you have to scrub and use soap, but it comes off. Then you always have a little left, the stuff INSIDE the very outside layer. Which you have to scrub hard to get off, you're mostly just scrubbing off that layer. \n\nFor blood, it can't get inside your skin, so it just dries on the surface. It's also water soluble, so it's easier to get off. The color is also from red blood cells, they're much larger than ink molecules, but the blood just stays in the cracks of your skin that are harder to clean. \n\nFabric: \n\nThink of a rope, the brown kind you see on ships in movies. \n\nThread isn't that much different, just smaller.\n\nInk will stain the fabric just easily as blood. The solvent spreads the ink into the fabric through capillary action and that's why when you draw on a white shirt with marker, you get the bleed where you aren't marking, the ink is traveling down the thread. \n\nBlood interacts with the threads in a similar way. Cotton will absorb water, so blood will absorb onto the thread just like ink. It will go into all the little nooks and crannies of the thread, and while red blood cells are bigger than the ink, they're small enough to get to the very inside of the thread. \n\nThen you try to wash the blood out, the red blood cells are inside that thread, they're trapped now, they flow in, but can't flow out. When you wash it, the red blood cells pop, leaving the red color behind, which is still trapped, stuck to individual cotton fibers now. \n\nThat's why you can wash out *some* of the blood, it's the blood on the surface of the thread, but you can't wash the blood that's on the inside of the thread. \n\n\nEdit: I avoided talking about prune fingers because it's contentious and irrelevant to this ELI5. \n\nPrune fingers are better at grabbing while underwater, but is it due to the absorption of a small amount of water on the exterior surface of your skin? Or is it due to the body increasing the porosity of the capillaries at the skin on your fingers that causes the swelling? It's currently being investigated and I have yet to see conclusive results from either side. \n\nHowever, it's irrelevant for this conversation. If you put your hand in a bowl of water, how long does it take to get prune fingers? How often are you floating your hand in blood? \n\nIf I put a droplet of blood on your arm, it will bead up and you can just brush it off. Or, you can take a cloth, and the cloth will absorb the blood. \n\nSo for this conversation, skin is waterproof. \n\nEdit 2: a couple people have mentioned that those with nerve damage don't get prune fingers, which supports skin being waterproof and that prune fingers are from a biological response. I haven't heard of this before, so I won't comment on it beyond saying that it's compelling proof. \n\nThat prune fingers is due to absorption of water by the skin was probably not something a scientist tested. It is a completely logical and sound thing for someone to assume, and even if skin is waterproof, that you *eventually* absorb *some* water is still reasonable. \n\nThese kinds of facts are very common, no one thinks to test them, there really isn't any reason to, until there is. That prune fingers is due to a biological response could be a very important fact for science, it can help teach us about localized responses, how local conditions are sensed, how the brain analyzes the information, and many other things. \n\nThis is why I question everything, if it hasn't been tested, then it is only a hypothesis, not a fact. Also, not to trust anyone, always read the literature XDl\n\nEdit 3: jeebus I gots gold."}

It‚Äôs anabolic steroid like testosterone or it‚Äôs hyperpotent chemical derivatives.\n\n\nAll steroids mostly work in genetic receptors. They tell the cells which genese to activate, and which regulatory proteins to send.\n\n\nAnabolic steroids switch on the genes responsible for building up muscle. Less myostatin gets produced, which normally prevents excessive build up of muscle as this is actually dangerous to ‚Äöfree wild‚Äò humans, because keeping up useless muscle wastes a ton of energy, Stone Age humans don‚Äôt have perfect access to food, thus the mechanisms that store energy as fat rather than muscle are normally the more active ones.\n\n\n\nIf you now supply a ton of testosterone, these normal controls get overwritten, more muscle mass is produced.\n\nAdditionally the body senses an excess in Sex hormones and thus tells the testes and ovaries to stop producing so many hormones, which will make them atrophy (become tiny) upon which they may not recover from at all and ever start producing sufficient quantities of hormones after long term use of excessive testosterone.\n\n\n\n\nThis isn‚Äôt specific to testosterone though, all sex hormone, I.e. estrogen, progesterones, testosterone in excess to what a human body would normally get will cause this (again gender is utterly irrelevant, testosterone and estrogen are what determines 99% of sex characteristics after all, look at anabolic steroid abuse permitted body builder competitions in Asian countries: the women look exactly like the men. )"}

They positioned themselves in front of the door, barring the way. One of the statues spoke up, explaining the condition to proceed: they must correctly answer his riddle.\n\nThe statue adorned in a blue tabard confidently asserted, \"The rogue stands among us, wearing the red tabard.\"\n\nThe statue donning the red tabard promptly countered, \"No, the rogue is not me, but rather the figure clad in green.\"\n\nUnyielding in its response, the statue clothed in green interjected, \"You are mistaken. The one in red assumes the role of the rogue.\"\n\nAddressing the perplexed adventurers, the initial statue resumes, \"So I ask you, discerning travelers, which of us truly embodies the rogue? Who among us is the righteous paladin, and who assumes the mantle of the enigmatic warlock?\"\n\nElena blinked as she stood before the three animated statues with an air of befuddlement. The gears of her mind churned in disarray, attempting to unravel the enigma before her.

If both the blue and green statues were telling the truth, the red statue would be the rogue, but that contradicts the fact that the warlock must lie. Hence, the red statue is identified as the paladin. With the paladin always telling the truth, it is concluded that the green statue must be the rogue. Consequently, the remaining statue, the blue one, is determined to be the warlock.\"", "assistant": "If one character ALWAYS lies, one ALWAYS tells the truth, and one can do either, then consider what we're told twice: that red is the rogue, as said by both blue and green. Since they say the same thing, either both blue and green are telling the truth, or both blue and green are lying. (I am interpreting the word \"assumes\" in the line \"The one in red assumes the role of the rogue\" as meaning \"is\" here)\n\nBut only the rogue and warlock can lie, and they say the rogue is wearing red which is neither blue nor green. So it must be that both blue and green are lying. That means red is the paladin and is telling the truth.\n\nThe red paladin specifically said \"the rogue is not me, but rather the figure clad in green.\" The paladin tells the truth, so that can be accepted as truth.

That was the case in Northern Europe and other cooler areas of the world because historically not much food was available in those places during the long, bitter winter season, if not cheese which can be prepared in bulk months in advance without decaying. So as winter rolled in and no crops could be grown for months on end, you didn't have much choice, you either ate cheese or starved. So the people that happened to be born with better lactose tolerance than others ended up being more well-fed and thus better at surviving winter and reproducing. This allowed for the genetic mutation that keeps the enzyme lactase active into adulthood to spread throughout the population.\nPeople in the Tropics never had to face a seasonal scarcity, since those places don't really have winters. That means there is a wider variety of foods throughout the year, so there was never as much selective pressure for lactose tolerance."}

A lot of the time is not found until it's causing someone enough problems to actually go get checked out.  And by that time,  it can be spread or grown in areas that aren't easy to remove it from without causing serious damage. \n\nLike my mother,  when they found hers,  she went to the ER because she thought she had a kidney stone.

I can explain this in a much simpler way.\n\nWhen the tendons that pull the fingertips get taught, force is placed on the entire finger to bend, so the finger naturally curls, and you cannot move the fingertip much in isolation. \n\nThat's the real reason why the fingertip doesn't move by itself very far without moving the rest of the finger. \n\nEND EDIT\n\n\n\nActually, they sort of can.\n\nLet's just talk about the fingers, excluding the thumb, which is a little more complicated. Actually, the index finger and the pinky are also a little more complicated, but we're going to go with the simplest possible explanation . \n\nYour fingers bend forward through the action of muscles that are actually in your forearm. These forearm muscles, there are two of them, divide into separate tendons, which are like long strings, which go through your wrist, and then to the fingers. \n\nWe call these two muscles _flexor digitorum profundus_ (FDS) and _flexor digitorum superficialis_ (FDP). This is Latin for the deep finger bender and the superficial finger bender. The tendons for the deep finger bender go all the way to the end of the finger. Each finger has three parts you can see, we call these parts each a phalanx, plural: phalanges. FDS goes to the base of the ~~distal~~ middle Phalanx, and FDP goes to the base of the ~~middle~~ distal Phalanx. \n\nBecause one muscle runs all of the tendons for each of these, fingers do not move entirely independently. Finger Independence can be trained, and involves activating different parts of the flexor muscles, as well as using the extensor muscle, the one that straightens the fingers, to resist flexion. \n\nActivating different portions of FDS and FDP separately, as well as activating the individual muzzles separately, is also a matter of training. Musicians, for example, gain a lot of finger Independence through practice.\n\nAlso, there are separate muscles called the lumbricals, these flex at the main knuckle but extend the fingers and are what allow you to keep the fingers straight while bent at the knuckle. Hands are complicated."}

Is it just for public familiarity to use orange?\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone, my thoughts were confirmed, reinforced, and I‚Äôve learned some new things!", "assistant": "The actual color of the sun is slightly greenish in fact! From the ground the sun appears kind of yellow because the blue wavelengths get scattered by the air. If you took the blue color of the sky and added it back to the apparent color of the sun, it would be a bit green.\n\nBut in answer to your question: images in science are almost always modified in some way in order to measure something useful. The sun is so bright to human eyes that an unfiltered true-to-human picture of the sun would just be a blank featureless disk. Which isn't very useful! Instead we put filters over the image to highlight certain things, like sunspots, or hotter or cooler regions of the surface. Most cameras used in astronomy are actually black and white cameras that have some sort of filter put in front of them, so you don't have to worry about what color you're detecting, only how bright it is. You can then turn the resultant picture whatever color you want before displaying it in order to help in communicating the information contained in the picture. For humans who associate the color orange with heat and fire, turning a black and white picture of the sun orange feels good and natural, and helps us to intuitively understand \"oh, the more yellow-orange parts are hotter, and the reddish-orange parts are cooler!\" or similar things."}

There are communicable, and non-communicable diseases. I could be taking care of a person recovering from a heart attack, someone fresh out of the operating room, or another with liver problems. It does not mean I would catch their diseases or problems. The trickier part is when there are patients who come in with communicable diseases like the flu, have C-Diff (clostridium difficile, very nasty bug), or even tuberculosis. With communicable cases like these, many facilities require PPE (Personal protective equipment), so we are required to wear gloves, gowns, masks depending on the situation. That, and proper handwashing. \n\nAs for the long hours, not all of us work that many hours every day of the week. \nThis is only a generality and does not apply to all nurses:\n12 hour shifts = 36 hours = 3 days on, 4 days off (in a 7 day work week), \n10 hour shifts = 40 hours = 4 on, 3 off, for example. \n\nSince the field of nursing is highly variable (not all of us work in a hospital), there are many differences in work environments.

For example, 300,000 jobs is just 0.18% of 159.5 million jobs. It doesn't take a large revision to the total number of jobs to make a huge change in the number of jobs added or lost.\n\nYou should definitely take the monthly job growth/loss numbers with a grain of salt.

Or is there some sort of mechanism or system in place to divert or destroy the junk before impact?", "assistant": "At orbital speed, any small object will just immediately disintegrate on impact rather than stay intact and penetrate like a bullet. That means that it is enough to have two or more layers between space and the crew - a collision might punch a hole through the outer layer, but probably not through the second because all its momentum is spread out over a larger area. \n\nBut if any large object hits the ISS, it might destroy the entire thing and kill its crew. For that reason, they track space debris with radar, and if it is estimated that it will pass the ISS (or any other satellite) too close for comfort, they will use their thrusters for evasive maneuvers. \n\nIn addition to that, at the altitude that the ISS is orbiting, there is still a very thin atmosphere. Anything flying up there is slowing down and will eventually fall back to earth. Which means that the ISS has to use its thrusters anyway to maintain its altitude, which can be combined with evasive maneuvers. It also means that debris at that altitude cleans itself up after a while.\n\nDebris is a much greater problem at higher altitude, above 500 km. There, the atmosphere is so thin that all that junk will basically stay there forever."}

In general EV's create more pollution during the production process than ICE (internal combustion engine) cars but significantly less during the life of the vehicle.\n\nDuring production, it's usually the batteries that are the bigger hitter, requiring some rare and harder to find metals. In the early days, the batteries would need a lot of these metals (cobalt and lithium for example) and there is controversy about ther workers conditions where these materials are mined. However modern EV's are much better at this and the processes have improved significantly but they are still not perfect. The argument against EV's here however seems to forget that a) we need all of these materials for all the other batteries that we need in modern life and the materials in EV's can be recycled and b) many of these materials are needed in some form for ICE cars too, like cobalt which is used (and can't be recycled) during the production of petrol and diesel.\n\nThen we get through life pollution. with ICE cars, this typically refers to the emissions that come from the vehicle exhaust but really should include fuel production too. EV's don't have an exhaust but obviously the electricity must be generated somewhere. If your electricity comes from wind farms and solar panels then it will be very green. if it comes from coal and gas it will be a lot less green.\n\nHowever there's some important points to register here too. the pollution from an ICE car exhaust is created next to you. it surrounds us in our towns and gardens and schools. the pollution in electricity generation happens far away at the power station, where even with nasty coal, you get massive economies of scale in terms of kW per gram of CO2 (and other things) and they often have pollution controls in place. \n\nAlso, you often have an input into where your power comes from. my electricity company promises to only supply green energy for example, and this can and will change over time. Petrol and diesel will eventually be replaced by synthetic alternatives I imagine, but that's a long way away from being available to the majority of the population. Electricity is.\n\nAt the end of the day, all forms of car propulsion are compromises. EV's are better at some things, petrol cars are better at others. Petrol is massively energy dense for example, significantly more so than hydrogen and current battery tech, but it pollutes. \n\nPeople get very religious about these kinds of things but it's a car. choose something that works for you. EV's work for me because most of my days end at home, I have off street parking and a home fast charger. I have a tariff that charges a lot less for electricity in the nmiddle of the night and thus a \"fill up\" for me is hugely cheaper than when I had a diesel. but YMMV."}

If a Chinook can send embers in enough numbers to jump a 4 lane highway with a center median, what are we expecting smoke jumpers to be able to accomplish?\n\nThe winds are so perilous and strong that it is Sisyphean to try and spray any water because it will probably just blow back on your or dissipate so much that the fire makes it immediately evaporate.

If the message reaches the target PC, then that PC will do the same. This is a very inefficient method, which is why hubs are obsolete. Switches contain memory, so they remember which PC is on which port, and will direct messages to the correct port without having to constantly broadcast to all ports.\n\n**Bridge:** A network bridge joins two networks together. Such as one PC sharing the network connection with other PC's. Things like transparent bridges create a seamless link, these are often times used by security devices such as firewalls. They will inspect network traffic and block anything that violates the rules.\n\n**Modem:** A device that converts network traffic into a format that can be used on the media that connects you to the internet; Whether that be fiber, coaxial cable, 3G/4G wireless signals, or a copper phone line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: What you have at home, which is often times referred to as a 'Wireless router', or just a 'router', is actually a combination of a lot of these devices. They are indeed routers, but also switches, wireless access points, and sometimes modems/gateways. If it contains a modem, it can be referred to as a residential gateway, if it doesn't, then it's a wireless router. Small businesses will often use these same devices, but larger businesses will use enterprise class hardware, where these devices are separate and usually mounted in an equipment rack."}

When newer consoles come out, the map changes, and it was programmed on the older maps. Your program doesn't know where anything is. It gets lost and feels scared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, older consoles may have had only a single processor. Think of it like a little person doing things inside your console. Newer consoles have more little people working inside of them. Older games, if they sent out a person to go do jobs, the jobs always came back in the order they got sent out, because there was only the one guy. Newer consoles have more people, so sometimes, the jobs come back in a different order and the game doesn't know what to do with the completed job. It is used to only getting one thing back at a time. This can make your game have a panic attack and shut down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, there are other programs that are on your console that also do work and help your game work. Think of them less like little people and more like the school you go to. These programs are filled with rules, whether its handling how your game looks, or what buttons do when they are pressed, or what sounds are supposed to play. Just like your school, these programs have rules. Your game was written on the old rules, and doesn't know what the new ones are. It may try to do something it thinks is fine and a hall monitor pops up and yells, \"You can't do that here!\" Or, maybe your game is allowed to do something that would make it's day easier, but doesn't know that it's not against the rules.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the appreciation and gildings!. A couple of things:\n\nI am not a programmer as a job. I had to drop out of college when I ran out of money. I wanted to work on video games, but it didn't pan out. My wife (who is much smarter than me) helped write the post. I am a locksmith. Also, there are apparently some caveats on weird wordings that didn't come across quite right, but others have responded below with far more technological information that I have. I encourage you to look through the responses, they are quite good. We tried our best for an ELI5, so the metaphors are imprecise. When I told my wife the prompt and what I was going with, she gave me an exasperated look and said, \"Oh my god, so much.\" Apparently it can be really hard, but some programs are written to not utilize the hardware in weird and quirky ways are much easier."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5 Why does it take so long to warm up in the spring, but it cools off so quickly in the fall?\n\nIt seems like after winter, it takes several long months in the spring before it's warmed up to a comfortable temperature outside, but in the fall the weather turns cold very quickly after summer ends. \n\nFor context, I was looking at a chart of average temperatures for where I live in the Boise, ID area, and from January to July for the average temperatures to go from 26-40 in Jnauary to 65-94 in July. When you look at the opposite end though, it only takes August to December to get to the bottom end (64-92 in August to 26-40 in December). \n\nWhy is it such a shorter amount of time to get cold than warm up?", "assistant": "It‚Äôs because you live in Boise. Boise is pretty far north in the US, it also isn‚Äôt near the coast.  It‚Äôs in a mountain valley, but still at a higher elevation than most US cities. It also has low humidity in the summer and high humidity in the winter. \n\nBeing further north, means you don‚Äôt get as much direct sun, for most of the year, other than summer. Being in the mountain valley means you are surrounded by higher elevations which are colder on average. It basically has the opposite effect of say Portland or Seattle where the Pacific is cold, but it‚Äôs still warmer than the air in the mountains, which keeps both of those warmer than Boise despite similar latitude. The low humidity in the summer and high humidity in the winter is also the opposite of most places in the US. Water holds heat more than air. Water also takes longer to warm than air. In most places, it‚Äôs more humid in the summer and drier air in the winter. This means that the warmer summer air tends to stick around longer and cooler winter air goes away faster. In Boise though, since the winter is humid, the air holds onto the cooler temperatures longer, and then loses the warmer summer air faster."}

If they collide hard enough, they overcome the activation energy, and you get an A + B. But the activation energy barrier is a bigger barrier this way round, because the C and D also must provide all the extra energy that gets stored in the A + B as chemical potential energy. \n* So for A+B -> C+D+heat to happen, the A and the B only need to have so much energy, but for the reverse to happen, the C and the D need a chunk more energy. \n* Now we raise the temperature. Every collision now has more energy. For the A+B, well, they often had enough energy before, so the new high temperature doesn't make much difference. For C+D, however, they often did not have enough energy to even form A+B, now it's much more likely they do. So although both reactions speed up, C+D+heat -> A+B speeds up more, ie, the endothermic reaction is favoured."}

What causes this? Does the body just \"give up\"? If that's true, how does \"dying of old age\" effect different people at different ages?", "assistant": "There will always be a more immediate cause than \"just\" dying, it's just that it's not always necessary or desirable to go in to the details. Sudden deaths tend to be failures of the circulatory system, such as heart failure or stroke, and it's possible to go in to more detail in each case e.g. a heart failure could be a heart attack (artery blockage), valve failure, electrical/nervous system. The general term \"stroke\" covers two different kinds of circulatory failure (blockage or bleeding). \n\nSo you could say \"dying of old age\" is shorthand for \"dying from one of those conditions that are more likely in old age\"!"}

If you start will a cloud and spin it, it gets pulled and flattened into a disc by the rotational forces. And then\n2. Because over billions of years, anything orbiting in a different plane has collided and been cleared out. It's like a bunch of intersecting hotwheels tracks. If the majority of stuff is orbiting in a plane, then anything not in that plane will - given enough time - collide with something that is. So whatever plane is dominant (has most of the stuff) will eventually clear out the rest of the cloud until (nearly) everything is all in that plane. \n\nIt's like all the collisions are averaging and cancelling out each object's momentum, until you're left with stuff all in whatever plane the whole cloud's average rotation was to begin with."}

Basically, the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections.\n\nSo while the armed forces swear to the Constitution, not the president, the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods (impeachment and the 25th amendment) by which a bad, crazy, sick etc. president can be removed and replaced. Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.\n\nHaving the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief. One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally. His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens.\n\nThis fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome, when (for example) Julius Caesar was able to become ~~emperor~~ dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally, rather than to the Roman Republic. \n\n*Edit:* Thank you for the gold!

Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?\n\nI don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is \"no\" and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.\n\nI know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to \"lose customers\", but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a \"no BS\" policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end. \n\nWhere did the idea of catering to customers no matter what start, and is there a possibility that it might end?", "assistant": "I think this question confuses 'The Customer is Always Right' with 'Customer abuse of Employees'.  Those have always been two separate things.  I'm speaking from the experience of working at Customer Service Desks at two different supermarkets:  Whole Foods and Wegmans.\n\n'The Customer is Always Right' is the general approach to a customer complaint or concern.  There are a couple of things going on.  First, if it is a matter of bad product, the cost of the product in question is usually trivial compared to the buying power of any given customer.  So if someone comes in with a dozen eggs and says one is cracked, I would tell them to go get another one and mark it paid.  I don't know if it cracked in their car going home or it was cracked in the store, but it doesn't matter.  I just spent a few dollars to make that customer spend a lot more dollars in the future.  \n\nCould that system be abused?  Yes.  And people do abuse it.  It happened on occasion that someone would buy prepared food and eat it in the store, but return to the customer service desk with half a plate and complain the food was bad.  Of course you know they're angling for a free meal.  But again it is risk/reward.  The cost of appeasing an abuser is usually less than the cost of accidentally rejecting a real complaint.  It also serves to get that customer out of the store as quickly as possible.  If they create a scene, it will make other customers unhappy too.\n\nAnother case is an angry customer.  Either they felt like they were treated rudely, or bad product had ruined some plans, or any of a myriad of reasons.  'The Customer is Always Right' in this scenario means deescalation.  You need to resolve the anger first before resolving the issue.  The quickest way to get this done is appeasement and empathy.  Tell them you understand and you apologize and that they're right:  it never should have happened.  You invite a manager into the mix - which also has the benefit of outnumbering them.  People shopping in supermarkets often don't want to be there.  Go in with the assumption that someone is having a bad day and you're usually right.  If you can make them happy and they leave happy, well then you're the one bright spot in the otherwise crappy day.  This brings them back to the store tomorrow.\n\n'Employee Abuse,' however, was NEVER tolerated in any place I worked.  Cursing out an employee, yelling and screaming, inappropriate behavior (I had one guy lie down on the service desk as if to take a nap once), or anything physical would get a customer escorted out of the store.  At Wegmans, that would have involved a cop and Whole Foods had their own security.  Whenever a customer got abusive, the customer was always wrong.  It's a health and safety issue at that point.  And yes, people do get banned for life.  Both stores also have their own 'inventory control' people:  essentially undercover shoppers looking for shoplifters or scammers.  You didn't want to confront shoplifters yourself, but notify a manager who would notify these folks (we rarely if ever knew who they were).  \n\nWhy does this work at big retail chains and not Mom and Pop stores?  It's really economy of scale.  Large retail stores are making a lot more money per transaction and doing a whole lot more of them, such that they can absorb the cost of a 'Customer is Always Right' policy.  And in the end, you encourage people to return and spend more money with the policy."}

Because of this, the centers of the wheels extend past the edge of the rim. This means you can put two wheels face to face, and bolt them together to the hub. When you look at a set of dual wheels mounted, you see the concave side of the outer wheel, so you see the lugs as being recessed. Since the front wheels are single, they mount them the same way they do the inner wheels of each dual pair, meaning with the convex side facing out."}

You‚Äôre also thinking about this from a very anthropocentric perspective and measuring progress in a particular way. The progress from single celled organism into complex life is an incredible increase in ability and we draw the lines between the stages. The difference between apes and humans represents 6 million years worth of evolution. If you were to talk more specifically about earlier versions of man, rather than apes it would be more recent but even so, it‚Äôs still hundreds of thousands of years. It‚Äôs not like these things came about overnight, and drawing this arbitrary line ape vs human (humans didn‚Äôt even evolve from apes mind you) and saying how different they are doesn‚Äôt actually make much sense. Compared to what? Compared to the dominance of other animals when they were the most dominant on the planet? There are plenty of times in the history of the earth that certain animals or plants have absolutely dominated the ecosystem with almost no equal. Dinosaurs for instance. \n\nAnother thing to think about is what is your ability compared to an ape. You can do certain things better than him, you‚Äôre more dexterous, you can probably solve problems better than him, but if you were left alone who would be better at surviving? He‚Äôs way stronger than you and similarly resourceful and has much better natural tools to survive, is a better climber and fighter. What does ability even mean? You can teach apes to do lots of stuff we can do.  We are only better because of the cumulation of thousands of years of humans working together and creating new things and designing a society which produces everything we could possibly need to survive, and far far more. If we suddenly wiped out all human knowledge and infrastructure, all concepts of language and everything the human race had learned and stored in society‚Äôs collective brain, and just put a load of infant or even young humans into the world, they wouldn‚Äôt do very well at all. \n\nOverall though there are a few super important things which happened to advance civilisation heavily which is what separates us most from other animals:\nFire (cooking, not dying super young from disease, able to preserve food longer)\nLanguage(form complex ideas and communicate)\nTools\nAgriculture to allow for communities and more time not spent hunting safer more reliable \nTransport wheels boats etc\nCurrency trade \nMaths\nAstronomy/ calendar \nScience \nOverall, instead of existing purely to survive like most animals, humans became able to spend more time and energy improving and were able to collaborate in communities formed by agriculture etc. language allowed us to actually express complex ideas.

That's why the debt ceiling debate a while ago raised concerns about the US defaulting on its debts- the debt ceiling sets a limit on how much the executive branch (who's in charge of paying the bills and raising funds) can borrow, and they hit that limit but still needed funds to pay off the debt.  \n\nTheoretically, it doesn't matter how deep you go into debt, so long as people are confident you are still going to be able to pay it off, thus letting you sell more securities to raise more funds to pay off your debts now.  People can't call in debts whenever, so the US can plan for decades ahead on how to pay back its debt.  For decades, the USA has been such a strong and safe investment that it can sell securities for really low interest, i.e. really cheap to pay off, sometimes even cheaper than inflation, making that debt literally cheaper than free.  But if the US, say, almost defaults on its debt every election cycle, people might start to get more hesitant, making debt more expensive and unsustainable."}

That makes the molecules attract each other strongly so it stays solid.\n\nWhile a carbondioxide molecule is a carbon atom tied to two oxygen atoms that shares two electrons with each carbon atom the silicon structure is different.\n\nInstead each silicon atom borrows from four different oxygen atoms, and each oxygen atom is tied to two different silicon atoms.

Understanding of autism is constantly evolving, and we likely still don't understand it fully.\n\nAutism is present from birth, is not transmissible or communicable, and cannot be cured. It is more often found in people who have other neurological conditions like epilepsy or learning difficulties, but it can occur independently too.\n\nThe specific symptoms of autism vary depending on the individual. Some common traits are:\n\n\\* Difficulty processing sensory input - this can vary from something as small as being easily distracted by moving objects to something as major as finding the feeling of certain fabrics against your skin completely intolerably distracting.\n\n\\* Difficulty with social cues or normal social behaviour - this can be as simple as being poor at picking up social cues, to being completely nonverbal and unable to communicate with others normally.\n\n\\* Unusual or atypical learning ability - varying from being easily drawn into fine details, to obsessing about specific niche interests, to rejecting things that *aren't* part of your specific interest set.\n\n\\* Difficulty in coping with change or uncertainty. Autistic people often feel most comfortable when their world confirms rigidly to their expectations and become stressed when unexpected changes occur. This ranges from 'normal' levels of discomfort and stress to extreme meltdowns and mental breakdowns.\n\n\\* Autistic people sometimes display 'stimming', a type of repetitive physical activity that self-soothes them and helps with stress levels. This can be as simple as tapping your foot when you're anxious, to complex, developed physical routines they feel compelled to perform when stressed.\n\nAutism is most often diagnosed in children. It's quite hard to diagnose in adults, because adults will generally learn to \"mask\" as they grow up - e.g. to suppress their autistic behaviours in favour of performing \"normal\" behaviour by learning how to perform it intellectually. For example, it might not organically occur to an autistic person to say \"good morning\" to someone first thing in the office. But they have the capacity to see that saying \"good morning\" is something that other people do, so they may start remembering to perform that action in an attempt to fit in.\n\nThis, obviously, makes it very difficult to tell the difference between someone who came up with the behaviour organically and naturally, and someone who merely *performs* the behaviour in an attempt to fit in.\n\nAutism has been more visible in pop culture lately, as public attitudes around it change. It has also become notorious for being a commonly self-diagnosed disorder, as a lot of the minor symptoms are widely applicable. Many people have low attention spans or don't like noisy rooms, but aren't necessarily autistic."}

The person dumping it simulates a request for the data across the whole contents of the cartridge, and what's on there is read and then written to a file.\n\nEmulators are a bit more difficult. Typically, emulators start by investigating as much as they can about the system they're emulating. What cpu is used, what instruction set it runs on, what is connected where to the CPU and how it's accessed. A lot of this is borderline trial and error using some of the games dumped from game carts to figure out what commands do what based off of what they might expect them to be doing. Think of it as reading a cake cooking instructions in a foreign language. You have an idea of how to cook a cake, so you can guess what ach instruction is actually telling you to do. Compare your guess with guesses from a dozen more instructions and you can start to figure out what each word means. Use that knowledge and you can write a program that will read the instructions and do what they say to do on your own computer."}

It's bad to put anything inside your body that doesn't really belong.\n\nEven if the talc powder used is pure talc and doesn't have any asbestos, it could be an irritant to the special skin inside your body (epithelium). That's because under a microscope, talc is made of very sharp crystals of rock. The jury is still out if this causes cancer or not. That said, it's probably best to avoid it and not put it inside your body.\n\nTalc has been used for such a long time that it is not considered a drug by the US government - it's a cosmetic. Cosmetics do not need to be tested and approved by the FDA the same way that drugs are.\n\nSo anyhow, whether you are a lady or a guy or someone in between, you can use talc on your outside parts but don't put it inside you.\n\nEdit 1: Typo correction."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: Why are most foods baked in the oven at around the same temperatures (say 350-425 degrees Fahrenheit)? Is there a scientific reason behind this common temperature range?\n\nAt least from what I've noticed most temperatures for food and other baking in the oven don't range below or above these temperatures despite the oven being capable of them. Anyone know why?\n\nEDIT: For those on the metric system, approximately 175-220 degrees Celsius.", "assistant": "When you cook, you're trying to get heat from outside the food to inside the food. There's lots of different ways to do that. Baking in an oven isn't actually very efficient! You can sear a steak on a very hot skillet in 2-3 minutes, but baking the same steak to the right doneness might take an hour in an oven. Because the oven's so bad at getting heat inside food, trying to turn the heat to the same levels as the skillet will leave you with a completely burned outside and a near-raw inside in a hurry.\n\nThere's also certain chemical things that happen in food when we cook it. At very high temperatures, beef \"browns\", which creates very pleasant and complex flavors. That's why fancy steaks are almost always seared. You can bake a smaller steak in an oven, but you'll never quite get the same kind of flavor that searing creates. Low temperatures also do things! Pot roasts are generally tough cuts of meat, but after being kept in a slow cooker at around 200 degrees for hours, the heat will have broken down much of the tissue that makes the meat tough and turned it into a tender, tasty meal. Brisket and many other cuts are almost inedible unless cooked this way.\n\nThat's beef, though. Why do most of the things we cook fall in the 350-425 degree range? Well, I'm thinking of a lot of the things I throw in the oven. Frozen pizzas, frozen snacks... I'm not trying to *cook* those so much as *warm* them. But \"hot air\" isn't super good at getting heat inside food. So if I crank the heat up too high, I'll burn the outside and have a frozen inside. (Microwaves are the opposite: they're better at getting heat *inside* food. That's why pizza rolls take 20 minutes in the oven but only 2 minutes in the microwave. But that kind of 'heat' isn't so good at browning, so it never crisps them quite right, does it?)\n\nThat's what's going on with a lot of foods, too. Go much hotter than 425 and the heat can't penetrate the food fast enough to stop you from burning too much. Go much lower than 350 and it's going to take hours to heat the food enough, and in many foods like bread it might be important to generate some steam before certain reactions finish. That's why a lot of instructions for baking turkeys suggest cooking at two different temperatures. In one phase, the goal is to slowly get heat inside the turkey without drying out or burning the outside. In the other phase, the goal is to brown the outside to create more flavor.\n\nCooking often involves a LOT of complex chemistry, and delicate balancing acts of temperature.\n\n### Update\n\nWow. This is without a doubt my most popular post ever. Thanks for the gold, and thanks for so many comments. I want to address a few things, it seems there's a lot of nitpicking.\n\nIn general, I wanted to cover \"high heat burns the outside before the middle gets hot enough, low heat takes too long and can't brown\". It's ELI5, not an exhaustive guide to the science of cooking. There's lots of dishes that can't take 300 degrees, lots of processes like denaturing proteins I didn't get into, etc. I already feel like the post is too long for ELI5, I couldn't talk about every potential interaction.\n\nSimilarly, I appreciate corrections on how microwaves work, but again that was really a one-off example. I know about how microwaves excite water molecules, and that moisture content matters, etc. It's still true a microwave can cook, say, a chicken breast much faster than an oven but in so doing you miss out on things like browning. All of this makes the post even longer and distracts from answering, \"Why do we bake things within a specific temperature range.\"\n\nSometimes, when explaining complicated topics to people who want a rough answer, it helps to make gross oversimplifications. I think /r/AskScience is far more appropriate for the level of detail most of you are striving to find!\n\nAnd yes, I do cook more things than pizza rolls. But it's a lot easier for people to relate to pizza rolls than \"that time I made spanakopita\", and if I'd started talking about baking bread I'd have been WAY too encouraged to get into the chemical details."}

The money is usually a royalty, which is a small percentage of sales, sometimes with a minimum guarantee so the licensor gets paid even if sales are low. Partners also agree on the term (how long the deal lasts), the territory (where it can be sold) and exclusivity (whether competitors are allowed to do something similar at the same time).\n\nA Nintendo √ó Campbell‚Äôs tie-in is usually a licensing deal. Nintendo, the licensor, gives Campbell permission to put Mario on cans. In return Campbell pays a royalty, which is a small percent of sales, often with a minimum guarantee so Nintendo gets a base payment even if sales are low. The contract spells out the term (how long), territory (where it‚Äôs sold) and exclusivity (whether similar deals with rivals are allowed). Nintendo provides brand guidelines and approves designs to protect quality and reputation, while Campbell actually makes, ships and markets the soup, with both sides doing some co-promotion. Campbell shares sales reports so Nintendo can audit royalties, and they pre-agree on things like safety, recalls and how disputes are handled. The upside is new revenue and buzz for Nintendo and extra shelf attention for Campbell, and the main risks are brand mismatch or production delays, so they build timelines and approval checkpoints."}

This is how you can tell roughly where you are in space when your eyes are shut. When you lose a limb, your brain doesn't have a great framework for the idea that part of its map of your body is suddenly gone. So sometimes, if it's experiencing nerve sensation in the area where the nerves newly 'terminate' (where otherwise it would have extended into the now-missing limb) it goes \"Aha! I know where this nerve goes!\" and generalises the pain to be in that whole limb, even though the limb is not actually there anymore.\n\n(This is also the reason why body integrity identity disorder (BIID) is a thing - it's thought that people with this disorder may have a faulty or incomplete 'map', which can leave out some body parts, causing their brain to not recognise that these body parts are actually *theirs*, which causes the desire for amputation.)"}

What is it about?\n\nIn the paper below, Hao Huang, apparently provides a solution to the sensitivity conjecture, a mathematical problem which has been open for quite a while. Could someone provide an explanation what the problem and solution are about and why this is significant? \n\n[http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/\\~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity\\_1.pdf](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf)", "assistant": "Think of it like a Buzzfeed quiz. You answer a bunch of multiple-choice input questions about seemingly random topics ('What's your favourite breakfast cereal?', 'What's your favourite classic movie?', 'What did you want to be when you grew up?', and so on), and you get a response back at the end: let's face it, it being a Buzzfeed quiz, it's usually which Hogwarts house you belong in.\n\nBut shock, horror: after answering twenty questions honestly, Buzzfeed informs you that you are a Hufflepuff, when you *know* that you're actually (obviously) a Ravenclaw. So you take the test again. You change one answer, and boom! Now Buzzfeed tells you that you're the Ravenclaw you always knew you were meant to be.\n\nBut you start to wonder: just how many of the input questions could you change in order to change the output? Some of them won't make a difference to the result; it doesn't matter whether you prefer Coco Pops or Rice Krispies, because the Sorting Hat only uses that to determine between Gryffindors and Slytherins, and based on your other answers you are *obviously* neither. On the other hand, some of them will. No self-respecting Hufflepuff would ever answer that their favourite classic movie is *Inherit the Wind*, so flipping that answer will immediately flip the output and put you in a different house, without you changing the answer to any other question.\n\n*That's* the sensitivity of a system. If there are three individual answers you could switch that would each change the output, we say the system has a sensitivity of -- you guessed it -- three. (In computer science terms, this is usually considered as a sort of true-or-false, 1-or-0 example, but the basic idea is the same: how many true-or-false inputs can you flip to change the true-or-false output?) This is a way of measuring just how complex the system is. There are other measures of complexity, but over time they were mathematically proven to be polynomial in nature. (That contrasts with it being *exponential* in nature, which would have set it apart from other complexity measures as being much more complex and requiring more time and effort to compute. You don't need to worry *too* much about what that means to get a surface understanding of what's going on; just understand that people suspected it might be polynomial like all the others, but hadn't yet proved it.) \n\nThe conjecture, and I'm really ELI5ing it here, is about whether or not the rules for sensitivity follow the same rules as other measures of complexity, or whether it's a weird outlier. The short version is yes, it follows the same rules. (If you want to get particular about it, what was proved was that 'every 2^n-1 + 1-vertex induced subgraph of the n-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least ‚àön', which is comfortably above my paygrade and well out of the remit of ELI5.)\n\nThe reason why it's so significant is because this was one of those problems that anyone who's anyone in the field had tried to make even incremental progress towards in the past thirty years, but had generally failed. Along comes Huang, and produces a proof that's two pages long -- that is to say, extremely elegant. It's the computer science version of a team of cryptozoologists spending decades searching for Bigfoot, and then the new guy on the team says, 'Wait, you mean Harry? Hairy guy, kind of blurry, lives in the woods? Yeah, he's on my bowling team. He's cool.' (In actual fact, the solution goes above and beyond what would be needed for a proof, so it's opened up several new interesting questions; it's closer to the new guy saying, 'Yeah, Harry's on my bowling team. Last week he brought the Loch Ness Monster and the Chupacabra. We went out for tacos. Nice guys. Want me to give you their Snapchat?')\n\nThat's why people are talking about it. It's not a *colossal* leap forward in terms of changing the field, but it's impressive that it was solved and that the solution was so neat."}

(Also, that cave actually begins at about 7,500 ft elevation and the bottom is at approximately sea level.)\n\n>Why doesn't the earth compress things like water does? Does gravity do different things to different materials?\n\nThe answer to the question you're really asking is that rocks actually have shear strength and you can tunnel through them without having them collapse, depending on exactly what you're tunneling through and how you build the tunnel. Water doesn't have shear strength. It just flows everywhere it can. So the reason you can have a 7,000 ft deep cave with a void that people can go into and survive, but 7,000 ft underwater would crush you to death, is that in the cave, the rock around you is supporting all of the weight of the rock above it, and the only pressure increase you have to worry about is air. Air has very low density, so you don't have to worry too much about the increased air pressure."}

Not sure if this is the right place to post this question, but I thought I would give it a try since the internet and networking seems super complex and I'm not a big brain.\n\nI play WoW and Final Fantasy XIV. Recently I've been in areas where hundreds if not thousands of players are in the same area in the game world. Client-side computer graphics/processing capacity aside, how come servers seem to chug/have lots of lag when everyone is one place, aside from that same amount of people being spread out across the game world? In WoW especially, the play quality of an entire server begins to degrade when this happens, despite few players being outside of that one area.  \n\n\nEdit: Well, that's a lot of answers. Thanks to everyone who has replied, I think I understand it a little bit better now!", "assistant": "Hi! 20 year MMO server-side engineering veteran here, so I'm delighted by this question. The best way to answer it is with a very specific example, to get you a general idea.\n\nOne of the most important checks a server has to do is to verify whether players are colliding with each other, or the environment, or are aimed right for weapons fire, etc. Because these checks are computationally expensive, we resort to clever tricks to avoid having to do them for everything in the world every time.\n\nOne trick is to partition your world. Take your game map, and divide it into four quadrants. If two players are in the same quadrant, you know you have to look closer to see if they're colliding. But if one player is completely in quadrant 1, and another is completely in quadrant 4, you can skip that check because you know there's no way they can be physically touching.\n\nBut say two players are both in quadrant 1. Well, you can also subdivide quadrant 1 into four quadrants!  1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d.  Now similarly, if both players are in 1a, you need to look closer. But if one is in 1a and another in 1d, you can skip checking them. You keep doing this until the quadrants become so small that further partitioning isn't very useful.\n\nAnother benefit with this approach is parallel computation. For example, you can have one server thread or process running the check on everyone in quadrant 1, and a separate process running it on everyone in quadrant 4. They can do this independently because you know you don't ever have to compare anyone across these quadrants.\n\nTrouble is, if EVERY player is in tiniest quadrant 1a-iii., now you're back to having to directly compare every character to every other character in the most expensive way possible, and there's no super easy or cheap ways to parallelize that computation. And that's when your server hardware starts to choke.\n\nThis example is only about collision. But the point is, there are probably 9-10 different places in MMO server development where we *conceptually* take similar shortcuts -- even down to simple things like just how much data a server can physically upload to players over its network card at once -- which rely on the assumption that not everyone is in exactly the same place.\n\n(Edit: tweaked a few words for clarity, based on some of the excellent follow-up questions I got asked.)"}

Like a parasite it's a separate organism.", "assistant": "The way this question is worded and the strong emotions surrounding the topic makes it difficult, if not impossible to answer this question in a way that will satisfy people who have strong beliefs to the contrary.\n\nPregnancy is a physically difficult and at times, dangerous process for a woman and she alone must bear the physical results of having a good portion of her body change drastically to support this new life form, using her blood, her nutrients, and whatever else this little life form requires to form and grow. To accomplish this, changes to the cardiovascular, hematologic, metabolic, renal and respiratory systems occur, which are considerable and taxing on the body as well as the woman's ability to conduct her life as she wishes. It's a major life change, not a minor inconvenience. \n\nIt should not the domain of others to decide for a woman if she is to take on these risks to support a life, that until the age of fetal viability, is unable to survive without her. Nor should pregnancy and child-bearing be used or viewed as the 'punishment' for having sex in an age where we have the safe medical technology to address this archaic line of reasoning. It's not a commonly held view that someone should heal without medical intervention if they fall off a roof, even if they choose to climb on the roof in the first place. Medical intervention, when expressly desired by the patient and not detrimental to other fully-functioning humans, should not be withheld on moral grounds. A fetus who has not yet developed functions sufficient to survive on his/her own should not be held above the rights of the woman bearing him/her. \n\nYour comparison of a fetus to a parasite is flawed because the parasite could theoretically survive in any body that has same suitable conditions as the current host, where as fetal transplants are currently not medically possible. Before someone injects, yes, embryo transplants have occurred but once the embryo transitions into a fetus and the placenta is attached to the uterine wall, it is wholly dependent and bound to the mother's body.

They grow in later stages too, early childhood birthmarks and late adulthood birthmarks are common.\n\n2nd part not so much since there are many types. We classify them in to 2 types: vascular and pigmentational. Vascular birthmarks occur if blood vessels in a particular area of your skin don‚Äôt form the way they should. For example, there may be too many blood vessels clustered in one area or the blood vessels may be wider than they should be. Pigmented birthmarks occur when there‚Äôs an overabundance of pigment cells in one area. Pigment cells are what give your skin its natural color.\n\nEdit1: So a lot of people asked about inverse or white birthmarks. As far as I know that is called depigmentation or in extreme cases vitiligo. It is mostly the same cause as the normal birthmark and quite common.\n\nEdit1: In my first comment I didn't know what causes birthmarks. Since then I've been enlightened. It is caused by a hereditary type of mutation that is actually a BENIGN skin tumor in the making.\n\nEdit1: Birthmarks are hereditary, just like everything else. You give or receive half of your genome, therefore what your parents have you and your children are more likely to have the same. This goes for birthmarks, breast cancer, arthritis and even stuff like alcoholism.\n\nEdit2: Birthmark is an improper term. We use nevus in medicine. The popular term suggests that it is in fact formed at birth and nothing else. That is factually untrue. They form arround birth most of the time, but many form in later stages of life too. The example of improper terminology I've been using in the comments is this: pineapple has nothing to do with pines and a bit with apples, jusy like birthmark has nothing to do with the actual procces of giving birth but a bit with when the mark usually forms."}

This means that even if you copy the data to another place, you can't access it until you provide the decryption key.\n\nThen the different forms of DRM are essentially varying levels of sophistication as to how you \"hide\" the description key. \n\nThe most basic game DRM will put the key on the box the software came in. You can break it just by sending someone a picture of the code.\n\nA mid-level DRM is something like kindle books. This has an encryption key that is based on your device's serial number. It's hard to break casually, but if you know *how* they work out the key, you can work it out too.\n\nA higher-level DRM might require you to ask a server for the key, which only lasts a certain length of time. If you ask for too many keys at once, or from too many devices, the server says no. But you might be able to just copy the key for as long as it's valid.\n\nA very high level DRM (such as denuvo) involves deriving the keys from your exact hardware configuration (so it won't work on another computer), plus connecting to a server to authenticate it, plus storing the key in a secure area of your processor, plus going to great lengths to hide how the game works and only decrypt things the moment they're required by the game and not a moment sooner, so you can't even copy anything out of memory..."}

Otherwise, the picture would not work. Why was this so necessary?\n\nEdit: woah this blew up while I wasn't looking! Thanks for the replies!", "assistant": "Channels on old CRTVs that had TV *tuners* are basically different frequencies that you tune your TV to, like how you turn your radio to a specific frequency to pick up a channel you wanted to listen to.\n\nEdit: it was channel 3 (or the selectable alternative to avoid interference) because the NES/VCR had to be talking in the same \"language\" (channel 3 frequency 60-66 MHz, channel 4 frequency 66-72 MHz, or channel 5 frequency 76-82 MHz depending on where you live and which had the least interference for you).\n\nBack in that day we had no way of transmitting the image and sound from the game console or VCR directly to the TV like we do today with S-video, component, HDMI, Display port, etc. So the simple solution was to turn the image and sound into radio ~~waves~~ frequencies and transmit it to the TV like a TV station. To comply with Federal regulations this TV signal from the console would have to be very weak so that it wouldn't interfere with any other signal. This means that the console could only transmit the signal a few millimeters to centimeters. To get around this limitation they used coaxial cable to carry the signal but you still had to tune the TV into the frequency the console/VCR was transmitting at.\n\nThis guy does a good job explaining that a NES and similar devices are actually mini TV transmitter stations.

To clarify some things:\n\n* I accidently put radio ***waves***, the NES doesn't transmit (yes it's a transmitter) radio waves, it transmits electric Radio Frequency (RF) to the RF modulator/adaptor that translates that signal into the frequency range used by the selected channel. (There's probably something I don't understand about this as I understand modulation is changing the frequency rate to transmit more and varied information u/maxwellwood did a great job expounding on this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/nud63i/eli5_why_did_old_tvs_require_that_the_channel_be/h10vhzt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).\n* Technically speaking anything that transmits electric RF also inadvertently transmits radio waves in the form of electromagnetic RF radiation. This is mitigated. Blocked by what is known as shielding.\n* Yes, I know about the two screw antenna connection. Technically, a coaxial cable is that two screw connection bundled into a single, shielded cable with a universal/standardized connector.\n* Yes, you can transmit your game console's frequency over the air to your TV with the appropriate Electric RF to electromagnetic RF amplifier. All electric RF produces radio waves as far as I'm aware whether on purpose or not. Doing this while remaining in the grey area of legality in most countries would get you a pretty crappy signal to the TV though at any distance you couldn't just use the cable.\n* All cables used to take audio/video (AV, A/V) from a device to a TV is a transmission of data regardless of electric verses electromagnetic."}

Android first did this via a virtual-machine (Dalvik), which is like a virtual computer layer between the actual hardware and the software (Java software in Android's case).\n\nLots of memory was needed to manage this virtual machine and store both the Java byte-code and the processor machine-code as well as store the system needed for translating the Java byte-code into your device's processor machine-code. These days Android uses a Runtime called ART for interpreting (and compiling!) apps - which still needs to sit in a chunk of memory, but doesn't consume nearly as much RAM as the old Dalvik VM did.\n\nAndroid was also designed to be a multi-tasking platform with background services, so in the early days extra memory was needed for this (but it's less relevant now with iOS having background-tasks).\n\nAndroid is also big on the garbage-collected memory model - where apps use all the RAM they want and the OS will later free unused memory at a convenient time (when the user isn't looking at the screen is the best time to do this!).\n\n---\n\niOS was designed to run Objective-C applications on known hardware, which is an ARM processor. Because Apple has full control of the hardware, they could make the decision to have native machine code (No virtual machine) run directly on the processor. Everything in iOS is lighter-weight in general due to this, so the memory requirements are much lower.\n\niOS originally didn't have background-tasks as we know them today, so in the early days it could get away with far less RAM than what Android needed. RAM is expensive, so Android devices struggled with not-enough-memory for quite a few years in the early days, with iOS devices happily using 256MB and Android devices struggling with 512MB.\n\nIn iOS the memory is managed by the app, rather than a garbage collector. In the old days developers would have to use alloc and dealloc to manage their memory themselves - but now we have automatic reference counting, so there is a mini garbage collection system happening for iOS apps, but it's on an app basis and it's very lightweight and only uses memory for as long as it is actually needed (and with Swift this is even more optimised).\n\n---\n\n**EXTRA** (for ages 5+): What does all this mean?\n\nAndroid's original virtual machine, Dalvik, was built in an era when the industry did not know what CPU architecture would dominate the mobile world (or if one even would). Thus it was designed for X86, ARM and MIPS with room to add future architectures as needed.\n\nThe iPhone revolution resulted in the industry moving almost entirely to use the ARM architecture, so Dalvik's compatibility benefits were somewhat lost. More-so, Dalvik was quite battery intensive - once upon a time Android devices had awful battery life (less than a day) and iOS devices could last a couple of days.\n\nAndroid now uses a new Runtime called Android RunTime (ART). This new runtime is optimised to take advantage of the target processors as much as possible (X86, ARM, MIPS) - and it is a little harder to add new architectures.\n\nART does a lot differently to Dalvik; it stores the translated Java byte-code as raw machine-code binary for your device. ~~This means apps actually get faster the more you use them as the system slowly translates the app to machine-code. Eventually, only the machine code needs to be stored in memory and the byte-code can be ignored (frees up a lot of RAM).~~ ([This is Dalvik, not ART](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7pvzmu/eli5_what_does_ios_do_differently_to_android_for/dskrltj/)). Art compiles the Java byte-code during the app install (how could I forget this? Google made such a huge deal about it too!) but these days it also uses a JIT interpreter similar to Dalvik to save from lengthy install/optimisation times.\n\nIn recent times, Android itself has become far more power aware, and because it runs managed code on its Runtime Android can make power-efficiency decisions across all apps that iOS cannot (as easily). This has resulted in the bizarre situation that most developers thought they'd never see where Android devices now tend to have longer battery life (a few days) than iOS devices - which now last less than a day.\n\nThe garbage collected memory of Android and its heavy multi-tasking still consumes a fair amount of memory, these days both iOS and Android are very well optimised for their general usage. The OS tend to use as much memory as it can to make the device run as smoothly as possible and as power-efficient as possible.\n\nRemember task managers on Android? They pretty much aren't needed any more as the OS does a fantastic job on its own. Task killing in general is probably worse for your phone now as it undoes a lot of the spin-up optimisation that is done on specific apps when they are sent to the background. iOS gained task killing for some unknown reason (probably iOS users demanding one be added because Android has one) - but both operating systems can do without this feature now. The feature is kept around because users would complain if these familiar features disappear. I expect in future OS versions the task-killers won't actually do anything and will become a placebo - or it will only reset the app's navigation stack, rather than kills the task entirely."}

Every reply so far seems to have missed the key fact that we DO store water when needed,  a whopping 1-2 liters of it. Because it is so heavy we don‚Äôt do this unless we discover we need to, i.e. we wait until an initial episode of dehydration. After an episode of dehydration, there is an change in water balance hormones (particularly aldosterone) to increase water retention. The next time you drink, the kidney retains water and promptly boosts blood volume by a phenomenal 20% on average, up to 40% in some individuals, even despite the blood dilution that this causes. Over the next two weeks the bone marrow increases red blood cell production so that hematocrit and O2 capacity per ml of plasma returns more or less to normal. The end result is that you carry around an extra 1-2 liters of blood for a while, largely to serve as a store of additional water.\n\nFun fact, this also occurs upon beginning a cardio exercise program, and is largely responsible for the ‚Äúexercise plateau‚Äù of weight that dieters often experience. New dieters who have also just started an exercise program commonly gain water for the first two weeks, often so much water that it hides underlying fat loss on the scale. Often the dieter maintains weight for the first several weeks (despite eating at a deficit), and sometimes even gains weight.

They usually go from the bottom on one side to the bottom on the other side, without having to go over it - that's where the journey time savings come from.¬†\n\n\nBut regardless, yes they'll have to deal with water. Not because train (edit: rain! Trains often do enter at the ends!) enters at the ends, but because many rocks are porous and there's a lot of water inside the mountain that will drip / trickle / flow in to a tunnel. Tunnels are often lined with concrete to stop water getting in, but this only works so well. They are usually sloped in order that water entering the tunnel will flow towards an entrance where it can drain to the outside."}

However, during the act of rev-matching, your clutch is disengaged from the input shaft, so at that point, engine speed has no effect on the input shaft speed.\n\nDuring the rev-match (i.e. while the clutch is disengaged), you move the shifter into the new gear, which is when the synchros do (and complete) their job synchronizing the speeds to allow the shift sleeve to slide over the new gear. \n\nThe clutch isn't released until after you're fully in gear (otherwise you'll grind the synchros) at which point the synchros have already done their job and are no longer in play since the gear is already connected to the shaft.\n\nSo then at that point, how does the RPMs you release the clutch at affect the synchros?", "assistant": "Rev matching reduces shock wear on the whole driveline - bushings, clutch, gears, bearings, etc. \n\nTo reduce sychronizer wear, you‚Äôll need to double-clutch, which is essentially the same as rev matching with the added step of closing the clutch briefly before disengaging it again and engaging the next gear."}

I know they're more of a collector's item nowadays, but haven't we invented any materials that are more durable or would otherwise be better for the job?\n\nMy boyfriend is really into records and he's tired of me pestering him about this. I've heard that records used to be made of something called shellac and then it turned into vinyl around the 1930s. But that only caught on when they started using lighter needles that didn't damage the record. It's almost 90 years later now, haven't they made a material better suited for the job? Maybe something that's more durable so they don't scratch as easily, for example.  \n\n\nEdit: I'm adding this because it seems to be coming up in the comments a lot: I am well aware that CDs and other digital media (mp3s, Spotify etc) exist. What I'm curious about it the reason why vinyl is being used for the big black records my hipster boyfriend likes.", "assistant": "I haven't seen a good response that actually talks about the properties of vinyl, so I'll give it a shot...\n\nThe reason vinyl is still used is because it is really perfectly suited to this task. It's cheap, readily available, very consistent, easy to mold, and most importantly - it's very quiet as a medium. We have stronger plastics, sure. But getting that clean impression from the stamper is important and vital for getting a record that sounds good. Old shellac records were noisy - lots of hiss, the surface was as good as it could have been for the time - but it's still not great. Not to mention, heavy, brittle... shellac was a lousy material for records.\n\nEnter vinyl - it's soft, flexible, and durable. Vinyl, as a material, is incredibly stable. It does not break down, and it's immune to most chemicals. I remember a forum post years ago where a guy tested various cleaning products on a Milli Vanilli album, in an attempt to see what could dissolve it. He eventually did find something - but he did find just how hard it is to chemically damage vinyl. This is also why records pressed in the 60's still sound perfect (assuming well cared for) - the plastic is long term stable.\n\nVinyl is very durable. Despite the fact that it can be easily scratched, it stands up to the weight of the stylus well, and an album can be played thousands of times on properly set up equipment without degrading. It's also very flexible - you can hold a vinyl record and \"wobble\" it back and forth and it won't damage it. Sure, you can break a vinyl record, but it's kind of hard to do this accidentally. It survives shipping well.\n\nThe surface of a vinyl record is very quiet, because the material is so smooth and soft. Making a record out of something like polycarbonate - the stuff they make CD's out of - would function, but the hard, brittle plastic would likely be very noisy, and it would probably be susceptible to the grooves chipping and breaking. Despite the fact that the stylus tracks at only about 2 grams, it's very tiny, and a diamond. The pressure at the tip is actually pretty high.\n\nShellac and vinyl are NOT the only materials that were used for records. Polystyrene was also widely used. This is what they made most 45 RPM records out of, back in the 60's and 70's. Hold one up to the light - if you can see reddish through it, it's polystyrene, not vinyl. This is a hard, brittle plastic somewhat like polycarbonate. These records perform poorly, and wear out quickly. The surface is noisier than vinyl, and the grooves don't hold up to the stylus like vinyl does. This material was used for 45's not because it was cheaper - but because polystyrene can be liquefied and injection molded. This meant that the stampers didn't wear out as fast, so they could crank out more records with less overall costs. They wore out quickly, but - 45 RPM singles were viewed as disposable, and sold cheaply. The wear problem was known at the time, and sometimes they would make vinyl runs of the same single for jukebox and DJ use."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/explainlikeimfive. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: When surgeons perform a \"36 hour operation\" what exactly are they doing?\n\nWhat exactly are they doing the entirety of those hours? Are they literally just cutting and stitching and suctioning the entire time?  Do they have breaks?", "assistant": "Neurosurgeon here.\n\nAbout 1-3 hours of that time is taken to get the patient under general anesthesia. This may involve placing monitors for blood pressure management and big catheters for blood transfusions and administering drugs. The patient has to be put to sleep and the breathing tube placed. At the end of the surgery the patient has to wake up from the drugs and the breathing tube taken out (if this is planned).\n\nA significant portion of the time is then spent after making the incision(s) dissecting down to the area of interest for the surgery. This may involve various different teams. For example if we were removing a tumor from the thoracic spinal cord this may involve cardiothoracic surgeons to help us get into the chest to get in front of the spine. Getting good exposure to the site of surgery is as important as the ability to do the surgery itself. \n\nOnce the area of interest is exposed the delicate part of the surgery might take place. If we are taking out a tumor from a delicate area of the brain or near the spinal cord, just chipping away at the tumor and taking small blood vessels to cut blood flow to the tumor may take 12 hours itself.\n\nNow this is the part where complications may happen intraoperatively that if not addressed right then and there can cause serious issues. Sometimes a significant amount of time can be spent correcting these iatrogenically caused issues. These are where all the ‚Äúroutine‚Äù complications that are common with the surgery can be addressed. For example if we are doing spine surgery and we unintentionally cut into the covering over the spinal cord (the dura) then it may add hours to try to repair the tear under the microscope.\n\nAfter part of the surgery sometimes the surgeon wants some interval imaging to see where they are at with the goals of surgery. The incision may temporarily be closed and the patient might go to an MRI to see if there is any residual tumor (if it is a brain tumor) or perhaps an angiogram procedure to see if the vascular lesion is all gone (if say we were clipping multiple aneurysm). Afterwards the patient might return to the operating room for final closure. Maybe this could take an hour or two.\n\nIf there is more work to be done it is possible you may need to do 12 more hours of work to get the last piece of tumor out or ligate the blood vessels you have to go complete the surgery. Maybe after this the surgeon might elect to go get ANOTHER MRI or angiogram to confirm that they are truly done with the goals they intended to achieve. It is possible that they send a piece of the tumor to the pathologists so they can freeze it and section it and get the diagnosis back to the surgeon so they can decide whether they need to respect the entire tumor or if they can leave some behind. This may take up to an hour.\n\nNext is the closure of the surgical site. Depending on how deep they are inside the body this could take hours. If another type of surgeon helped expose the surgical site, often they come back in to surgery to help close the site.\n\nAt the end of the surgery, depending on what type of surgery it is and what the expected recovery of the patient is, it is possible the patient may get other surgeries done during the same general anesthesia session. For example if we take a huge tumor out of the brainstem area and we expect the patient to have significant swallowing issues due to disruption of the nerves that control swallowing, maybe they will need a stomach tube (gastric tube) to be fed through a tube in the future, or even a tracheostomy (breathing tube) so that they can recover postoperatively. This can take 4+ hours.\n\nAll in all this can add up to 36 hours but it is truly rare to go that long (at least in neurosurgery). If you are going to do that we usually like to stage the surgery over two different surgical episodes. For example if you have a giant tumor in your spine and you need the tumor removed from the spine from the front and screws and rods placed from the back you might do the back part on the first day, let the patient recover a little bit and then take them back for the front part.\n\nAnd yeah the surgeons have breaks. The residents will go for breaks while the attending operates and vice versa. Multiple attendings will give each other breaks. The anesthesiologists will switch out multiple times. The longest surgery I‚Äôve been in lasted around 36 hours. As a resident in that surgery I watched the metro train which is outside the OR window go by at least a hundred times."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5 Spooky Action at a distance\n\nI realize this can be a hard one to ELI5, but from what I gather, when two particles are created from the same source, one can be measured, and that measurement will somehow determine its own properties, and ASLO the properties of its counterpart particle? Does just measuring its properties make it be, what its always been? Or does the measurement have a physical impact on it, that also somehow has a physical impact on its counterpart particle even if they're light-years away?", "assistant": "You're describing entanglement. That's not spooky action at a distance. Spooky action at a distance is relevant to it, but does not require it. \n\n\nSpooky action at a distance is wavefunction collapse. It's what Einstein referred to it as, somewhat as a joke but expressing legitimate concerns with the interpretations of quantum mechanics. It is NOT entanglement, despite wide spread belief otherwise on the internet. \n\n\nWe have a quantum particle. For simplicity, let's say this is a particle in a box. A 1D wavefunction between two walls. The particle does not exist in the walls or past them, so wavefunction strength is zero there. That is, zero chance of finding the particle there. Within the box, the wavefunction is, well, a wave. The ground state is just a large wave between the two walls. Like a guitar string. Peak amplitude in the middle. This peak has the highest probability of you find the particle there, but it could be found anywhere along this wave. You can have higher harmonics for a messy wave, just like a guitar string. This analogy seems a little absurd, but it's basically how things work. The atomic orbitals of electrons around an atom are really just the 3D harmonics, completely analogous to the 1D harmonics you see on a guitar string or the 2D harmonics you see on a drum. \n\n\nAs far as we can tell, this wave is the particle. There's no local hidden variable that says where the particle actually is as a classical ball somewhere in this box. It is this wave. Exists in all the locations at once. And this wave does wave like things that a ball hidden in it could not do, like interfere, diffract, and tunnel (evanescent waves, classical waves tunnel too). \n\n\nNow, when you go and make a measurement, that is interact with the particle, you'll find it somewhere. Most likely in the middle, but could be to the left, the right, or anywhere along the line. Now, when you make this measurement, you now know where the particle is. It's like it's wavefunction shifted and is now bunched up where you found it, not spread out across the box. However, the problem with this is, how did this wave shift instantly? There's no transition. How did the wave function collapse. Say the particle was found on the left. The right instantly did not have the particle. Spooky action at a distance. We have no idea really the full details of how this works. It's an open question, if it is even knowable. Lots of interpretations, even one where it doesn't ever collapse and all states remain. Ei, the many worlds. \n\n\nNow, wavefunctions are linear. Add two wavefunctions and you just get a single new one. Again, just like sounds. Guitars, drums, and bass all come to your ear drums or a record groove as one wave. Or that is for quantum stuff, you can make two particles share a wavefunction. Just put two in the box for example. This is entanglement. Entanglement allows you to move the spatial extent of the wavefunction to a larger area and make it spookier, but it doesn't create the spookiness. You can make two particles share a wavefunction, and then without measuring them, move one. They now still share a wavefunction, and you can still get a lot of weird correlations between them as if they were still connected in a way. \n\n\nNow, in either case, be it a single particle or entanglement, the spooky action can't actually carry information. So can't send stuff or talk faster than light. The information is equivalent to say you had a red ball and blue ball, blind folded yourself, put one in a box, travelled across the planet with that box, opened it, found the red ball, and instantly knew a blue ball was sitting in your house. Your knowledge instantly updated about a remote place, but you can't use this for say communication. And the information only moved at the speed you moved the box at. Entanglement is the same, any actually information exchange would be the speed you moved the one particle away at or the speed at which you talked to the person at the other end to compare results. You can't flip the one particle one and off like a switch and send Morse code to the other. That's not how it works."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5 why does light sometimes \"goes off\" when going through spaces that are narrow enough?\n\nEDIT: the phenomenon is called \"magnetic shadow effect\".\n\nSo, this was bothering me since childhood: when light (mostly dissipated, unfocused) is going through narrow spaces (like between two almost closed fingers or between curtains), it seems to \"shut out\" after a certain narrowness.  \nExample: I expect the sunset light that is going into my room through thick curtains with a \\~4cm gap in between to repeat the shape of the gap onto the wall; mostly it goes right, but if you bring the curtains close enough (\\~1cm) or form a \"hourglass\" shape from them (by closing the middle but leaving space between curtains everywhere else), the pattern on the wall just disappears at places where expected to just be thinner or weaker: instead of the hourglass pattern on the wall I see just two straight vertical lines with their ends a little blurred (no thinning towards the space between the lines, just sudden blackening).  \nWhen slowly closing the curtains fully, you can see the line becoming thinner to some degree, but after a certain moment the line just disappears when you expect it to narrow further.\n\nAnother way I would describe it is as the two shadows on a wall would \"magnetize\" each other when close enough, or form a \"bridge\" when close enough. Why would light do this? Is it somehow \"grabbed\" and absorbed by the objects it is going between? Isn't the light kinda too fast for that and the objects (curtains) too light (pun unintended) to attract it?\n\nAs you may have guessed from the clumsiness of my description, I don't really know how to properly formulate about this phenomenon and google it, so it would even be helpful to just provide me with possible query to search. Thank you!", "assistant": "I believe what you‚Äôre describing is called the magnetic shadow effect - [MinutePhysics made an excellent video explaining it far better than I can](https://youtu.be/MuvuxHXLzls), since the effect itself is rather nuanced and very odd.

At home, people are often impatient, and/or layering the stuff on too thick, and/or using curing lamps that aren't strong enough. That will result in the nails not curing right, and as they are also often touching the nail bed, that results in having fake nails leeching chemicals into your body for weeks. \n\nSince an allergy is built by exposure, that means a person will be having acrylic nails seemingly without problem for weeks, months, or years, until the immune system is fed up with it. Usually after a break from the nails, or when exposure is suddenly higher due to a particularly sloppy nailjob for example, and then decides to attack. Then boom, an acrylics allergy is born.\n\nAnd it turns out that is bad, because the same materials are in replacement joints (for example). Now the acrylic in replacement joints does not leech, because that is very well cured. But once you have developed an allergy to it, that does not matter anymore. Your immune system is ANGRY at that material now, and since our immune system tends to hold grudges, in the future even the most minor exposure can now cause reactions.

This means that if you tried to sign into your account with a wrong password from your phone twice, then from your laptop once, it would lock you out of your account. Many high security financial apps have this.\n* relative attempts: they lock your device out, but not the whole account. Websites use information about your device (e.g. from your cookie), session, IP, etc. and just lock you out from that attempt. While this works against manual hack attempts, like your boyfriend trying to log into your messenger account, it doesn‚Äôt protect much against automated hackers. All a hacker has to do is reset their proxy to a new location, clear their cookies (both of which can be automated in a matter of milliseconds), and try another set of passwords as part of a new attempt. Most social media accounts that are optimised for access rather than security use versions of this, with varying levels strictness of how they define a new login attempt. \n\nBut in any case - use good, strong passwords. And don‚Äôt use the same one everywhere - some websites are incredibly easy to crack or reverse engineer so your security online becomes dependent on the weakest link.\n\n**edit: to add a bit more context on spraying, these attackers don‚Äôt typically try a bunch of passwords on a few accounts. Instead they try a limited set of common passwords on a bunch of accounts.

You can watch him talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/vdW9XDBuxjU?t=3079) or take a deep dive into his [Wiki](https://theportal.wiki/wiki/Graph,_Wall,_Tome).\n\nCould someone (1) literally translate the paragraph so a layman can grasp the gist of it, switching the specific jargon **in bold** with simplified plain English translations? Just assume I have no formal education in math or physics, so feel free to edit the flow of the paragraph for clarity's sake. For example, something like:\n\n>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Spacetime is a ~~pseudo-Riemannian manifold~~ ***flexible*** ***3-dimension space*** *M*, endowed with a ~~metric tensor~~ **composite list of contingent quantities** and governed by geometrical laws... etc.\n\nAnd (2) briefly explain the importance of this paragraph in the big picture of physics?", "assistant": "Imagine that I gave you a map, drawn on paper, and some basic geometry tools, like a protractor and a pair of compasses. Now suppose I told you that any question about the world, anything at all, could be answered by making geometric measurements on the map. That would be pretty amazing, right?\n\nWell, this paragraph is saying that that's basically how it is. All of the fundamental forces of nature can be explained by geometry. The map is at least four dimensional, and Pythagoras's theorem doesn't apply the way you think it does, and the algebra is horrendously complicated, but it's all geometry."}

Why was this necessary?", "assistant": "Doctor here, many people are confidently wrong in this thread. Real reasons are :\n\n1) Blood in stomach or vomiting blood doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you swallowed it. It can be your digestive tract bleeding, which would be absolute top priority to rule out or treat. Clearing it is a necessary step to check it with endoscopy (camera probe) if need be. \n\n2) Full stomach is a vomiting and aspiration (choking) risk in a trauma patient, and an anesthesia risk for the same reason. Emptying stomach protects airways and makes an eventual emergency surgery easier and safer. \n\nAll the comments about iron toxicity are completely absurd. \n\nPeople with any kind of digestive bleeding end up *severely iron DEFICIENT* since the GI tract can only absorb a small % of the iron we eat, so you‚Äôd necessarily end up with less iron in you bloodstream at the end of the day. The amount needed to be toxic would require you to drink more blood than you‚Äôll ever have, obviously killing you from blood loss in the process. \n\nAnd even self-inflicted iron toxicity was a thing, when a kid is wrecked and bleeding profusely from a car crash, it would be ridiculously insignificant in the list of things you‚Äôd have to take care of in emergency."}

The speed of sound varies and is directly related to the density and stiffness of the medium it's traveling through -- in other words, how tightly packed the molecules are.

Instead gasses move from areas of high pressure towards lower pressure, so in reality things are being pushed *into* a vacuum instead of it being \"pulled\" by some \"vacuum force\".\n\nSo why does gas \"stick\" to Earth? The answer is simply **gravity**. Gas has mass and is attracted towards other mass like anything else, and the atmosphere falls down for the same reason a rock does.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/explainlikeimfive. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: Why is automation lagging so much in air travel compared to other applications?\n\nWouldn't the airspace be an ideal ground (sorry) for automation given the relatively huge distances between vehicles and the relative lack of conflict points for travel paths? I'd imagine automation should've started earlier with planes rather than with cars and trains. It also seems like airlines would have a massive incentive to drop a large percentage of the pilots from the payrolls, keeping far less of them for just supervision and remote operation during emergencies and unscheduled incidents - one person could oversee several flights at the same time. Also, hijackings would be pretty much eliminated and pilot errors would probably be significantly reduced.", "assistant": "Just to add a different perspective here, I'm an enroute air traffic controller. I handle a large chunk of airspace that could have 25 aircraft on my frequency at any one time that flow through at a rate of about 70 an hour, every hour. \n\nThere are way more conflict points in the sky than people think. Our job is to ensure planes pass safely with either 5miles laterly, or 1000ft vertically. You'd be amazed at how many times a day, without intervention, aircraft would infringe on those golden standards. Hundreds of times a day, per controller.\n\nI always explain to people it's like an everyday scenario where you're walking down a busy street. How often do you have to slowly turn and meander to avoid people? What happens when the person in front of you walking towards you keeps turning the same way, you both end up doing that little dance and squeeze past each other. That little dance to squeeze past is what happens without proper ATC separation and is called TCAS, an automated last gasp air to air deconfliction to avoid impact. This is very rare but very important if needed. We in ATC make the adjustments early, maybe move a few people in front of you across the road, and turn a few others slightly out of the way. Maube speed you up slightly so the person behind doesn't bump into your heels. Maybe we tell all people heading west walk on the right side, all people heading east walk on the left side. We put rules in place to create predicibility and order.\n\nTo answer your question, our radar systems use a huge amount of automation. They electronically talk to each other and neighbouring airspace receive information via automated processes. Our safety systems are automated, to point out conflicts and potential future issues and hotspots based on traffic flow in the short and medium term. A vast amount of work that would have taken huge human resources previously, now just occurs in the background. This frees up workload for the controller, allowing their capacity to increase safely by a large amount. The less time we have to think about stuff we don't need to, the more we can push traffic through safely and efficiently basically. \n\nWhat automated systems can't do is dynamically adapt on the flip of a coin. Some examples:\n\nHot humid days: aircraft that usually easily climb at 1500-2000 feet per minute, now maybe climb at 1000fpm maximum, less if they're fully loaded. Our job to notice trends and work accordingly to provide safe separation. \n\nWinds aloft shifting: an Eastbound aircraft has a tailwind of 80 knots, suddenly shifting to 150 knots, now making them traffic for an aircraft you didn't expect. Gotta adapt and resolve. System predicted winds are wrong, for any number of reasons, and the system doesn't see the conflict but the controller does.\n\nBad weather and turbulence: days like this really test our patience. Automation doesn't come close to being helpful here, because it's constantly changing and moving. We speak to pilots ahead and ask what conditions are like, for aircraft behind. When you're on board and hear the pilots say there's turb ahead, mostly that's because a controller has advised them of such, so they can put pax signs on in advance. \n\nEmergencies: an aircraft suddenly depressurisss and starts an emergency descent. We notice and move everyone else out of their way (eg aircraft below big turns given immediately) and give them time and space. \n\nThe crux of it is because we are in two way coms with all aircraft on the frequency, we can do things very quickly and efficiently. Automation plays a huge role, but efficency would suffer if the controller was taken out of the loop. And what happens when automation fails, is the controller now expected to sit down and cold start resolve a busy sector with ongoing issues? \n\nImo the controller should always be apart of the decision loop, as with pilots, so that they don't fall behind what the machine is doing. Safety has developed in this way so far, and aviation is a world leader for safety management systems, while also making bank every day of the week."}

Water being subject to heat is easy to understand but water being exposed to \"nothing\" (the vacuum). Is it really just that nature abhors a vacuum and therefore tries to fill the space and the water vapor fills the space best?", "assistant": "Boiling points are determined by temperature and pressure.\n\nBoiling happens when the vapour pressure (the pressure of the vapours rising from the liquid) is equal to the external pressure (in normal circumstances, atmospheric pressure). When these forces are equal, water will start rapidly turning into water vapour, or steam.\n\nPressure in a liquid is also related to temperature, so as you heat water, the vapour pressure increases until it equals atmospheric pressure, when it will then start to boil.\n\nSo, higher external pressure means higher temperatures are required to make the liquid boil.\n\nIn a vacuum, the external pressure is 0 so any amount of heat at all is enough to cause the water to instantly boil and vapourise."}

Yet, the process for properly blocking ads on a phone is exponentially more complicated, and the fact that many websites have their own apps such as Youtube mean that you might have to find an ad-blocking solution for each app on a case-by-case approach. Why is this the case?", "assistant": "On a phone OS, things are a lot more compartmentalized. Like one app is basically shut off from all other apps, and can only interact with certain OS systems if they get granted permission (like camera, microphone, etc). Basically, security is a lot tighter.\n\nA browser extension is sort of like a separate app that interacts with, and changes the behavior of, the browser. Phone OSes do not generally allow this sort of dynamic behavior-changing, as part of the tight security.\n\nAlso, apps must be certified before being listed on the app stores. Certified to only behave a certain way. And the ad-blocking extensions are generally created by 3rd parties. So in order for the extension to be part of the certified app, it would just have to be built into the app from the get-go, which the largest browsers wouldn't do because then they wouldn't be making ad revenue. Some browsers, like ~~Braze~~ Brave I believe, do in fact have ad-blocking built-in.\n\n\\-----\n\nSide note: a great way to block ads on a phone (or at least Android) is to go into your network/internet settings, and set a \"Private DNS\" to [dns.adguard.com](https://dns.adguard.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----------------------------\n\nEDIT (2022-6-6 13:11 UTC) : Wow, lots of people liked, upvoted, and awarded my non-sober late-night answer. Oh man....\n\nJust wanted to add a few points, many of which brought up by commenters, so thanks to all. I believe my original answer is not the best, so I want to add more details since it's very visible on the top. (probably more likely to be seen this way than by someone else posting a new answer, right?)\n\nI think there's a better answer to the question than what I wrote, which involves 3 main components\n\n1. Difference in how information is accessed.\n2. Difference in device capabilities, and the ease of those capabilities.\n3. Difference in the companies responsible for development, and their goals and design decisions.\n\nTo elaborate on these 3 points:\n\n1. On a PC, you access almost all internet information directly through your browser. This makes it a convenient place to add in an ad-blocking filter, in just one spot. On a phone though, you also access through a lot of separate apps, so it's just not as convenient to put one browser-based ad-blocker in place. It's also not possible to add \"extensions\" to most apps.\n2. A phone is much smaller than a PC, and fine controls are harder to access. An extension within a browser is easy to manage on a PC, but a lot harder to manage on a small device. They make the browser apps simpler for this reason.\n3. Google gains a lot of profit from ad revenue. It would make sense that their design decisions are affected by this. This, combined with the mentioned security and compartmentalization, is maybe not the main answer to the question, but I'd say it certainly drives the capabilities of apps within a phone OS away from easy custom extensions like we have on a PC. By comparison, Microsoft does not gain heavy profit from ads, but from software, so they'd be more incentivized to allow (or make easier) the building of software on their OS that can be more customizable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Regarding my private dns suggestion:**\n\nDon't blindly follow any random internet stranger's recommendations, make sure you read up on things yourself before deciding what to use or not use.\n\nDefault DNS resolution services are there because they are the most trusted. By using a 3rd party service you're possibly gaining some benefit (like ad-blocking) in exchange for possibly using a less trusted service. Yes, this service can now see all website that you're going to. They could potentially tell your system to go to a different website than the one you thought you were going to.\n\nThere are other ad-blocking private dns services, a few have suggested nextDNS.\n\nOthers have brought up that adguard is Russian-based. There may certainly be legitimate arguments to not using Russian-based services, but just be wary of making decisions based on bigotry (unintentional or not).\n\nYou can also build your own ad-blocking private dns service, lookup \"pi hole\" for more info there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, make sure you read comments and other answers too, thanks!"}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: What do doctors mean when they say they are ‚Äúevidence-based‚Äù?\n\nShouldn‚Äôt all doctors be evidence-based? Do some doctors operate on speculation?", "assistant": "Actual doctor here.  Pretty much all the answers you've gotten so far are dead wrong.\n\nMedicine itself has been around for all of human history, even going back to early prehistoric people.  Up until relatively recently, it was an art where a wise teacher would impart their knowledge to a students in a rather personal way.  So students would learn the classical wisdom of their day, based on anecdotes passed down from physician to physician over time.\n\nThe scientific revolution didn't show up until the 1700s, and modern medicine didn't really start until the mid 1800s with the development of germ theory.  Before that, doctors relied on speculative and unproven proposed mechanisms of disease, such as foul odors.  And statistical analysis of data didn't appear until the late 1800s/early 1900s, which is really what we're talking about with evidence-based medicine today.\n\nThroughout the 20th Century, researchers started to study things that doctors had been doing for hundreds of years to find out what matched with evidence and what didn't.  It wasn't until [the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#Clinical_decision-making) that doctors started to become aware of how little of the body of medical knowledge at the time was actually backed by clinical data and how much variability doctors had in treating patients: Doctor Bob might be using a method he swears is effective to treat this disease, but Doctor Sarah two towns over is doing something completely different!\n\nBasically, by the 1980s, doctors were doing a whole lot of smart things, but the things they were doing were based on the collective wisdom of the medical community as a whole: they were making decisions based on what they believed was the \"standard of care\" that all the doctors around them followed, and the \"expert consensus\" of the leaders in the industry.  Researchers looked around and saw that medical experts were doing a pretty good job, but not the best job possible.  Armed with increasingly large studies that were able to make generalized conclusions about entire populations of patients (epidemiological data,) by 1990 it was time to introduce a new concept into medicine: \"evidence-based care.\"\n\nEvidence-based care is an approach to care that ties clinical practice to the best available evidence.  Individual studies get analyzed, studies of studies find general trends, systematic reviews coalesce these into robust generalizations, and expert groups translate these generalizations into clinical guidelines that are published for other physicians to follow.\n\nThese guidelines tell us such things as which medications are the best for managing blood pressure, what our treatment goals should be for people with diabetes, who should be screened for what cancers and when, and so on.  If your doctor ever starts talking about things like your 10 year risk for having a heart attack or stroke, they are directly using evidence-based tools to assess that for you.\n\nSo when we say \"evidence-based medicine,\" we don't simply mean that our doctors should be competent.  We're instead talking about a deliberate change in how we approach the body of medical knowledge and moving from treatment based on classical wisdom to those that have been proven in studies.\n\nAnd no, your doctor probably isn't following evidence-based practices 100% of the time.  Old habits die hard, and there are a lot of things still part of the medical standard of care that do not match the latest evidence.  For example, if you go to your doctor with abdominal pain and are diagnosed with mild diverticulitis, your doctor might prescribe you an antibiotic and tell you to avoid seeds and nuts.  This is a very common approach, but it's also not evidence-based: the current evidence shows that antibiotics are not needed if diverticulitis is mild, and seeds/nuts do not actually cause diverticulitis.  But not everyone is up on the current guidelines or accepts them, and so you may be treated the classical way even though there's not much evidence to back it up.  \n\nThere are also times when guidelines conflict with each other based on different interpretations of how to best translate evidence into action.  For example, everyone agrees that screening for breast cancer is important, but a false positive on a screening test can mean additional testing, painful workup, anxiety for the patient, and possible surgeries with complications, all for something that turns out to not be serious.  Some organizations focus more on the benefit of catching as many cancers as early as possible, while others focus more on reducing the harms from overscreening, and these lead to different judgements on when the best time is to screen.  In the USA alone, the United States Preventative Task Force, American College of Radiology, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Cancer Society all have slightly different opinions on how the current evidence should be translated to general screening, so when I discuss breast screening in an office visit, I have to decide *which* guidelines I should use for my patient.\n\nLastly, doing studies takes time and money, and some things are easier to study than others.  There are still a lot of things done in medicine that don't really have a huge body of evidence to back them up: heck, there are medicines that we prescribe that we still don't 100% know how they work.  We can't just stop treating our patients' conditions while we wait for the evidence to appear: in the absence of solid clinical guidelines, we must fall back to classical wisdom and the consensus of experts.  Luckily, over time, that gap in evidence is shrinking, but it still doesn't cover every medical topic out there, and there's a good chance we'll never be able to go 100% evidence-based, because there is always a chance that the patient in front of you will be the one exception to the general rules.\n\nIn short, \"evidence-based medicine\" is a process that leaders in medicine have been using to deliberately reshape our approach to medical treatment over the past \\~35 years, NOT a simple statement that doctors should try to be competent (though that's important, too!)"}

Since it has been a very succesful project and people really needed it and actually used it, it got more expensive (i.e. they had to pay out more) than planned.\n\n\nEdit: to expand on why this can happen with businesses as well - many businesses sell products or services at a loss, expecting to make up for it later, or by simply miscalculating.¬†\n\n\nGaming console has often been sold at a loss for example, expecting to cover that loss by selling additional hardware like controllers and games over the lifetime of the product.\n\n\nMany businesses that are starting out also sells at a loss, expecting factors of scale to bring the cost down and the profit up later, or to simply capture enough of the market that they can raise prices later.

However, if you drive into town and purchase the same item from a locally owned store with employees who live near you, lots more people receive a direct benefit from your purchase.

Investment wasted. Even if the hold is cleared on appeal for fair use (not likely), the video tends to significantly underperform for the rest of its life on the platform. The initial boom of channel subscribers coming to check it out was wasted, and it won't get picked up by the YouTube algorithm to spread and get seen.\n\nSince a single strike on a 10 second clip of music in a 30 minute video essay might potentially strike a video and waste all of the surrounding effort, these kinds of content creators have an incentive to mute the audio to protect their work.\n\nOn the other hand, cheap reaction channels that can just sit in front of a monitor and churn this shit out for little cost can just eat the hit if the video is stricken for copyright.

Asking an AI, \"is this song playing in the background of this clip?\" is a lot less demanding of it than asking it, \"is this video clip taken from a scene from the Avengers?\" That kind of thing still tends to be left to human reviewers rather than automated strikes. They'll only strike your video IF it even gets noticed in the first place, and IF the human thinks it's actually infringement. Audio is all automatic.

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: If red and purple are at opposite ends of the visible spectrum, why does red seem to fade into purple just as well as it fades into orange?\n\nWouldn't it make sense for red to fade into green or yellow more smoothly than purple? They are both closer to red in wavelength than purple.", "assistant": "Gah, some people responding here need to just not. \n\nAlright I'm going to spend some time breaking down how colour works for you before getting to the why. It's needed background information, but feel free to skip over the bits you know. \n\nColour as we perceive it is not something inherent to the spectrum of visible light. It's related, but there is nothing about a photon with a 2.61whatever eV of energy that makes it inherently or objectively blue. The photon does not give a shit, it's just a photon that carries some energy and has the related wavelength. \n\nThe perception of colour is a product of biology. Your eyes send an electrical signal to the brain and your brain interprets that information. It turns out being able to easily distinguish different objects is useful what for not getting eaten and finding things to eat, and most materials reflect different and unique parts of the light spectrum. Thus the eye evolved to give more detailed information to the brain and the brain evolved to process that into what we perceive as colour, thus reducing your chances of getting eaten by wolves or licking a poison dart frog. \n\nSo how does the eye work. I'm sure you're aware that you have specialized cells in your eyes called rods and cones; rods cells are responsible for low light vision, cone cells for vision in bright light.  You've also probably been told that rod cells are achromatic which is why you don't see colour in darkness, but cone cells are chromatic and allows you to see colour in other times. This is accurate enough but a little overly simple. Each one of those cells, cones and rods both, contains a pigment, and like any pigment it absorbs light around a certain wavelength and reflects others, and when it absorbs light, this produces a response in the cell to the brain. They also respond most strongly at a certain wavelength and then falling off in a general bell curve type shape to the left and right of that peak. \n\nYou can see an image of that [here](https://www.unm.edu/~toolson/human_cone_action_spectra.gif) (note, not to scale, comparative only) but to list: \n\nRods activate between  400nm and about 640nm, with their peak around 510nm. \n\nBlue cones activate between  370nm and about 550nm , with their peak around 420nm. \n\nGreen activate between  400nm and about 700nm with their peak around 530nm. \n\nRed activate between  400nm and about 700nm, with their peak around 560nm. \n\nThis is why the light off a 420nm ish laser looks really really blue. It's activating the blue cones in your eyes very very strongly, and everything else much weaker. However most things aren't lasers and don't produce/reflect monochromatic, instead  they reflect multiple different parts of the spectrum. That results in more than one wavelength of light hitting your eyes at the same time. You'll also notice there's quite a bit of overlap between the ranges of activation for the cells in your eyes. It's that overlap combined with mixed wavelengths triggering more than one type of cell at a time that gives rise to the rest of the colours. So while the visible spectrum looks like [this](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c9bd877c0d7d5a998e2dfba6736d3389) the diagram of colours we can percivce looks like [this](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZKral.png)\n\n\nSo now we can get into the why. That last diagram  there is a C.I.E. Chromaticity chart. The X,Y coordinates describe the relative strength of activation of each of the cone cells in your eyes. Closer to the bottom right, red is most strongly activated , bottom left blue and top left green. If  I point violet light at your face (so bottom left) and then start to also add in red light by increasing the intensity of the red you can follow the charting from violet and start moving into purple into a sort of light fuchsia to a dark fuschia and so on. Eventually there's just tons of red wavelength light bombarding your eyes, in comparison to blue wavelength light and the red overwhelms the blue and you see nothing but red. This is also why a really really bright violet wavelength light appears blue, but bright purple still looks purple. Intense violet light just triggers blue cone cells strongly so our brain goes \"oh that's really blue\", but intense purple still maintains that mix of red and blue we perceive as purple\n\nAlso contrary to what you may have heard, rods do play a role colour vision, however not all of the time. You need light that's dim enough for rods cells to be activated, but not too dim that the cone cells stop activating. This is why colours get a bit funny around dusk/dawn or in areas with dim light from streetlamps. Rods activate quite strongly in the sort of blue-green area of the spectrum. So when the light gets dim reds start to become more dull or even close to black, but you're more sensitive to light in that green/blue chunk spectrum and can still make out greens and blues. \n\nThat also why things like aircraft cockpits use red lights. Rods are not saturated by the red light and remain active thus allowing for night vision when looking outside of the aircraft, but the red light stops you vision from shifting entirely to scotopic (night) vision where the pilots would no longer be able to read their instruments. It's also good way to observe nocturnal animals who usually can't perceive red very well and are thus still in the dark as far as they're concerned."}

Is gullibility or naivety a factor?", "assistant": "Destructive cults often prey on people when they are feeling lost and seeking a purpose in life, recovering from a loss or tragedy, or both. They can also prey on people's greed and arrogance, offering easy riches and/or a confirmation that they're  naturally a superior breed of person. \n\nThis means that, in the right circumstances, almost anyone could be lured into one. The idea that cult members are all unthinking and stupid sheep or whatever, is for the most part, [a myth](https://matthewremski.com/wordpress/are-cult-members-stupid-are-cult-recruiters-evil-lets-talk-about-viruses-instead/) and one that can lure people into false sense of security, at that. \n\nMost destructive cults will claim that they have simple, easy answers to all or at least most of the problems in the world. And most importantly, they will make you feel safe, accepted, appreciated and loved when you're feeling alone and unloved. \n\nOf course, this won't last. It will slowly become clear that love and acceptance are conditional on absolute obedience and it will be abruptly withdrawn if you displease them in any way. And as time passes, the kinds of demands made of you will become more and more draconian. And by the time you maybe start to realize that maybe the cult is up to no good, you're to find it's incredibly hard to get away. \n\nAbusive relationships often work the same way, but they're generally only between two people, not a group. \n\nBut pretty much no one gets pulled into a cult or abusive relationship by being told upfront, \"Yeah, I'm gonna beat and starve you and lock you in a closet if you do the slightest thing to annoy me.

We are not necessarily awake the whole time, I would say I am usually able to get at least a short 30min nap, but I have had many many sleepless nights and days. Some services may do weekend call where they are on call for 72 hours straight but not in hospital. That being said, all you need are a couple bad cases or unfortunate things to happen and you could be working nearly straight all weekend. \n\nOne of the variables most closely associated with errors is patient hand over, so partly one reason why we work these hours is to reduce the number of times a patients care is handed over. I imagine it like a game of telephone where a phrase is whispered around the circle and by the end of it sounds totally different.\n\nPersonally I have not noted making any catastrophic mistakes towards the end of a shift but I do not do procedures as a rule overnight or at end of a call shift unless absolutely necessary. I know I have definitely forgotten information when handing over to the next physician in the morning though just from sheer exhaustion. Also, I know residents who have been in accidents when driving home from the hospital after being awake for 30+ hours. \n\nIn terms of \"why not increase the number of residents/medical students\" question - it's slightly different in Canada due to our healthcare system. Our resident salary is government funded and so the government determines how many residency spots they are willing to fund each year. This is in turn determined by things like patient loads and safety, job prospects (eg. neurosurgery jobs are tough to come by so there are fewer residents each year). So it's not as simple as just opening up more spots, because ultimately the money has to come from somewhere AND this person needs a job at the end of all of this 13 years of post secondary education."}

Lower is better.  It is a pitching metric for how often a pitcher lets a runner on base.\n\nOPS is On-base Plus Slugging.  You take the hitters On Base Percentage (OBP) and add it to their Slugging Percentage.  OBP is Walks+Hits / Plate Apperances.   It is the percentage of time that a player reaches base in any manner that doesn't result in an out across all plate appearances they've made.  Slugging is a little bit more complicated.  It signifies how a player gets on base.  Not every \"on base\" is equal in value.  This captures that by adding (hits + doubles + 2\\*triples + 3\\* homeruns)/at-bats.\n\nAdd up OBP and Slugging (SLG) and you get OPS.  It is a very good measure of a player's overall offensive production.\n\nWAR is a lot more complicated.  It is also not directly derived by stats such as hits, walks, at bats, homeruns, etc.  It is supposed to normalize a player's offensive and defensive value to their team but factors in how every other player in the league performed as well.  If I told you that I won a race by running 10mph and finished in last place in a race by running 12mph, what would that tell you?  That maybe I ran a 10mph race against amateurs and a 12mph race against pros.\n\nThat is sort of what WAR is doing.  In a given season, the average player might hit for .250  average.  Maybe the rules are different.  Maybe pitchers got better.  Who knows.  In another season, maybe hitters hit for .275.  If I hit for 260 in that first season, I'm a little above average.  And if I hit .260 in that second season, I'm below average.  A team might be better off replacing me since my \"Wins above Average\" is now below that of a replacement player. WAR has more to do with just average of course.  But I'm tryin to put it in simple context.\n\nWhat is a replacement player?  Possibly someone waiting to get a start in the majors but is currently in the minors.  There may be someone better out there that can add value to the team instead of the player that is performing below average.\n\nOPS has a similar stat, called OPS+.  That normalizes OPS to an average across the league.  If you are above that value, you have an OPS north of 100.  If you are below, you have an OPS less than 100.  If you are 110 OPS, you are 10% better in the stats that deal with OPS."}

We don't want to do that too much to algae because that could choke the lakes and seas, killing fish and devastating the ecosystem. Similarly, we don't want to do it to bacteria because bacteria were brought up properly by their parents and always share- by which I mean that they can transfer their genes laterally to other species. Think C.Diff is bad? Imagine if it develops a growth rate that's twice as fast. Not good.  \n\nWhat we *are* doing however, is looking into plants. Depending on when you last studied biology you may or may not know that there are many different types of photosynthesis. Most plants use C3 photosynthesis, which was a lot better back when there was more CO2 in the air and less oxygen, but is increasingly inefficient. Some plants use C4 photosynthesis, which works better in all sorts of ways. C4 plants use less water, grow faster, and generally need less fertiliser. Sugar cane is a crop that naturally uses C4. A lot of work is being done to engineer more plants to use C4 photosynthesis, which would have the benefits of more food for less water and fertiliser, but equally take more CO2 out of the air.  \n\nTL;DR, we're trying to make plants grow faster and more efficiently as a way to give more food and take more CO2 out of the atmosphere \n\nEdit: a few follow up questions have been quite common;\n\n- No this would not be a good solution to climate change, most of the CO2 taken up would be released by decomposition, however trees modified to C4 could help with reforestation efforts by growing quickly. C4 trees could possibly grow faster than C3 trees, and if the total amount of biomass increases as a result, then more CO2 will be sequestered.  \n\n- There are many scenarios where C3 is better than C4; it tends to be better in cooler, wetter environments with lower oxygen levels. However as the climate warms up, C4 will be increasingly important. \n\n- No, growing algae in vats would not be a good solution. Any fuel generated would release this CO2 back into the environment. Yes, this would possibly reduce the amount of new CO2 being added to the atmosphere by preventing fossil fuels being burnt, at best this is carbon neutral, it doesn't actively decrease the CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n- A lot of people are upset by me using the figure of 25% more efficiency for C4 plants. The fact is that around 25% of all photosynthesis reactions in C3 plants go wrong, trying to fix O2 rather than CO2, in a process called photorespiration. If you want a source for this, see:\n\nSage, R.F., Sage, T.L. and Kocacinar, F. (2012) Photorespiration and the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Annu. Rev.

For instance, how many people do you think it would take to survey, on average, to find two people who share the same birthday? Due to probability, sometimes an event is more likely to occur than we believe it to. In this case, if you survey a random group of just 23 people there is actually about a 50‚Äì50 chance that two of them will have the same birthday. This is known as the birthday paradox.\n\nWe can work out the odds that nobody in a group shares a birthday - i.e. they all have different birthdays.\n\nIf we ignore February 29th (which is a complication that makes very little difference), then:\n\n* All possible dates work for person 1.

In this way CO2 could be used as a component of a battery, with a fairly high efficiency.\n\ne.\n\nTo charge the battery we could cover it in millions of self-assembling thin film solar panels, designed to convert solar energy directly to chemical energy for easy storage and transport and to do so with a high efficiency.  These small charging panels would be subject to high winds, rain, UV exposure etc. so they'll have to be discarded and re-synthesized on regular intervals. Fortunately they ae fully biodegradable, and pose no environmental threat."}

Eg a metal bolt on the wooden leg of a table, and its purpose is to spread the pressure of the bolt across a broader area, so you can tighten more without the bolt just sinking into the soft wood\n\nEdit: you do also see rubber or plastic washers for metal on metal fastenings, this is usual to prevent vibration from loosening the bolt over time.\n\nEdit 2: wow - thanks everyone! Many people have pointed out other reasons why washers are used in addition to the above including to prevent certain types of corrosion, to carry the wear for fastenings which are frequently used (like on access panels) and to seal against moisture.

So why not just leave the original weight instead of taking it out and having to add it back again?", "assistant": "Mass (effectively weight on Earth) requires force to move and force to change direction.\n\nLower mass allows faster acceleration and braking, and less forced required to change direction.\n\nForce is still required when turning so downforce provides a greater friction and grip that allows the car to turn.

Every few seconds, the front-end will request the back-end to serve up the next 20 or so seconds of the movie you are currently watching, and put them in a buffer (hence the term buffering). As your video keeps moving forward, these buffered seconds keep playing to give you a seamless experience.

What am I missing?", "assistant": "The YouTube channel Engineering Explained [did a great in depth video on the subject. ](https://youtu.be/7dfyG6FXsUU)\n\nIt's worth watching the full 16 minute video, but the answer is that the grid would need about 25% more capacity if every single person in the US switched to electric vehicles. And the grid operators can easily increase the capacity by 25%. The electric grid from 1960-2000 increased capacity by 4% per year, so it would only take about 7 years to fully increase the grid.\n\nAs for why it can get overwhelmed by AC during heat waves, that is a business choice not a physics choice. The grid could be designed to handle any demand from all the AC. But that only happens a few days a year and not even guaranteed every year. That peak capacity is wasted most of the time.

It took them many years to be able to make sense of what they're seeing and connect the image of a cube with the tactile sensation of the same cube they're holding. And if the surgery came too late, they would never be able to learn to see because the areas of the brain that normally process visual inputs are already taken by other systems."}

When a processor ingests an instruction, if it points to a location in memory it uses a number to define where that is.

The 32bit limitation only makes 4gigs addressable.¬†\n\nWhen a processor is running the instructions and data, usually, match the bit-width that is stated.

I appreciate it and I understand now. \n\nSpecifically how are batteries different? \n\nSo, all the small batteries are the same output of 1.5v right? AA, AAA, c, and d I think. They just have different capacities. So if you wired a D battery into something that typically uses a AAA, it should work but just last longer right? Which means that the sizing is just for different sized applications. \n\nAlso, on batteries like car batteries, how are they all the same size and same voltage but have different cca? What determines the cold cranking amps? And how would that matter anyway? The starter needs a certain amount to turn the motor over. As long as it gets that more would just be wasted. And the starter and wiring and all that in the car doesn‚Äôt change, only the battery. \n\nFinally, for car and motorcycle batteries, batteries that get charged, how do they go bad? What goes bad? The acid? How? If so, why don‚Äôt we just replace the acid? You already can buy batteries without that you have to fill yourself. If that‚Äôs what makes them go bad why don‚Äôt we just replace it?", "assistant": "A battery is made up of 1 (or more) cells. Inside each cell is an anode, a cathode and electrolyte in between.\n\nYou can make these parts out of various different materials to obtain different voltages, but the voltage will always be the 'same' for those selections of parts - a lead-acid cell will always be 2.1V nominal.\n\nYou can increase the capacity of a cell by just adding more anode, cathode and electrolyte material - this usually takes up more space, so the entire cell becomes bigger.\n\nYou can make the maximum rate at which the chemical reaction occurs faster by increasing the surface area of the anode and cathode - high CCA batteries have many, many thin plates, where cheaper storage batteries have less plates but thicker material.\n\nPrimary cell batteries, also known as non-rechargeable, have a kind of chemical reaction that does not work in reverse, so once the electrode material has been used up, it can be discarded or recycled.\n\nSecondary cell batteries, also known as rechargeables, have a operational window that allows for them to regain most of their original capacity when recharged - as long as you don't overcharge or over discharge it, the electrodes are not damaged and they can be cycled many times.\n\nDamage in secondary cell batteries usually happen when the electrode material deposits on the wrong place while recharging, so you get build-up in one part of the plate and a shortage somewhere else - once too much build-up has occurred, the cell can \"short circuit\" when a positive and negative plate touches without electrolyte in between. This cell can be repaired by removing the plates, cleaning them, replating them where material is lost and then putting them back in.\n\nObviously it's difficult to remove and repair plates in batteries that are physically small, but it can be done for car or truck batteries.\n\nYou can get higher voltages  (such as 12V for cars, 24V for trucks, 800V for porsche EV) by placing many individual cells in series, depending on your needs."}

Can someone explain lambda to me as a beginner?\n\n  \nWhat is it used for?", "assistant": "You probably are used to variables storing data like integers, strings, lists, and so on. By using lambdas, variables can also store *functions*.\n\nWhy is that useful? Well let's say we want to write a function for filtering out bad data out of a list.\n\nAs an example, let's say we just want to filter out all the odd numbers, keeping the even numbers:\n\n```\ndef filter_out_odds(list):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for x in list:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            filtered_list.append(x)\n    return filtered_list\n\n\nlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nfiltered_list = filter_out_odds(list)\nprint(filtered_list) # prints [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\nNow imagine we want another function that filters out all the even numbers, keeping the odd numbers. One way of doing that is to copy/paste our existing function and alter it to do what we want:\n\n```\ndef filter_out_odds(list):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for x in list:\n        if x % 2 == 0:\n            filtered_list.append(x)\n    return filtered_list\n\ndef filter_out_evens(list):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for x in list:\n        if x % 2 == 1:\n            filtered_list.append(x)\n    return filtered_list\n\n\nlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nfiltered_list = filter_out_odds(list)\nprint(filtered_list) # prints [2, 4, 6]\nfiltered_list = filter_out_evens(list)\nprint(filtered_list) # prints [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\nThat's fine, but imagine we wanted to be able to filter the list by all sorts of different criteria. Say we want functions for filtering evens, odds, primes, perfect squares, and so on. That would be a lot of functions to write, and a lot of repeated code!\n\nInstead, we can make *one function* that takes a lambda as an argument, where the lambda tells the function whether or not the list item should be kept or filtered out:\n\n```\ndef filter_list(list, keep):\n    filtered_list = []\n    for x in list:\n        if keep(x):\n            filtered_list.append(x)\n    return filtered_list\n\n\nlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nis_even = lambda x : x % 2 == 0\nis_odd = lambda x : x % 2 == 1\n\nfiltered_list = filter_list(list, is_even)\nprint(filtered_list) # prints [2, 4, 6]\nfiltered_list = filter_list(list, is_odd)\nprint(filtered_list) # prints [1, 3, 5]\n```\n\nNow, if we wanted to filter the list to keep the primes, or perfect squares, or whatever, we can just define a new lambda which checks if its input meets the appropriate condition, and pass it to filter_list as an argument, instead of writing a new filtering function for every kind of filtering that we want to do.\n\nIn general, you can think about a lambda as storing a little snippet of code in a variable, and functions can take lambdas as arguments, allowing the caller to alter their behavior in an open-ended way.\n\nNote, however, there are subtle differences between lambdas and the idea of storing a function in a variable.

What was the first thing to go up in cost, creating this chain reaction? Could it have been avoided if the initial thing did not rise in cost?", "assistant": "For one, at least some inflation is a policy decision. The government manages the money supply and does so in a way to target modest inflation as deflation is terrible for an economy and modest inflation provides an incentive to spend and invest.\n\nExtremely broadly, inflation comes from one of two sides, demand or supply. \"Demand pull inflation\" is where people have a greater willingness to spend money on stuff (perhaps due to greater levels of employment or an increase in the money supply). People start bidding up the price on the limited supply of stuff available, pushing up prices. \"Supply (or cost) push inflation\" is when our ability to make stuff becomes constrained but people still have just as much money.\n\nBoth of these factors are, to some degree, at play all the time. For the past few years consider the following (also extremely broad) drivers of inflation. There was a *huge* amount of stimulus governments utilized in the face of Covid. This flooded cash into the economy and, all else equal (which it, of course, was not, but this is eli5) that increases prices.

That little tunnel opens occasionally to let fresh air in and flush out any moisture to the back of your throat. \n\nSometimes, when you're sick, the little tunnel swells up or gets blocked. Air can't get into that little room so a little vacuum forms. That vacuum sucks in the drumskin making it tighter than normal. When the drumskin tightens, it doesn't work the same and it makes sounds seem dull. \n\nWhen something opens that tunnel, like when you get over your sickness or you pop your ears, air comes back to the room. The air can come back in slowly, so you barely notice, or it can rush in and make a \"pop\". \n\nThe returning air relieves the drumskin and makes it easier to hear. If the problem with the tunnel isn't quite fixed, the vacuum and the \"pop\" might happen over and over until everything is fixed. \n\n**Bonus ELI-an-adult-redditor:** The eustachian tube (ET), which ventilates the middle ear space, may fail to function for a multitude of reasons. Often it's congestion of some type that temporarily blocks it or causes inflammation which impairs its function. Some individuals simply have dysfunctioning ETs and have chronic trouble equalizing middle ear pressure. In normal conditions, the ET opens frequently throughout the day before any significant pressure can build in the middle ear space. For this reason you don't really notice a change occur. When pressure has been allowed to change over time (e.g. in cases of cold or congestion) or pressure has changed suddenly (e.g. upon take-off or landing in an aircraft), a sudden opening of the ET is much more apparent and you get the classic \"pop\". If your congestion is ongoing, you get these prolonged periods of negative middle ear pressure with only brief moments of relief. \n\nMiddle ear immittance is a story for a different day. The short end of it as it relates to this thread is that the negative middle ear pressure sucks in the tympanic membrane (TM; ear drum), changing its frequency response and reducing its ability to transduce acoustic energy (sound). As the ET opens, pressure within the middle ear approaches that of the surrounding atmosphere, which is typically ideal for normal transduction of sound. \n\nEDIT: **Source:** I'm a **(EDIT: removed full credential to maintain anonymity)** audiologist, so I've spelled this out a few times in the past.

This is an interesting one. During my high-school days, most of us here in India couldn't afford a decent calculator. We all had one of those cheap ones that can do basic BODMAS and additionally, square roots. Log books were also rare and used to go out of stock pretty fast.\n\nThere is this brilliant trick that used to work perfectly to find the log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ of any number upto 3 digits on this regular calculator:\n\n1. Type the number.\n2. Recursively take its square root 19 times.\n3. Subtract one.\n4. Multiply the result by 227697.\n\nAnd miraculously, it gave the log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ(x) accurate upto 4/5 decimal places. Sometimes even more. How does this work?", "assistant": "Here's how I reverse engineered it (and then reverse these steps back to see how it was first made). I'll use ~ to denote \"approximately\"\n\nThe trick basically says: \n\n227697( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ log_10 x\n\nNatural logs are what you always want to work with, so I multiply both sides by ln 10, we get:\n\n524292 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x\n\nNow that constant in the front is very close to 2^19 = 524288, so we get to:\n\n2^19 ( x^(1/2^19) -1) ~ ln x\n\nDivide both sides by 2^19, and let u = x^(1/2^19):\n\nu - 1 ~ ln u\n\nwhich is true near u=1 (which can be seen by taking the tangent of ln u at u=1, or by Taylor series). For x < 1000, x^(1/2^19) is very close to 1, which is why this approximation is so good. \n\nIf you didn't need quite as many digits, you could similarly find appropriate constants to only have to recursively square root fewer than 19 times. For example, \n\n444.72 (x^(1/2^10) - 1) ~ log_10 x\n\nshould be a decent approximation as well. Written in terms of the steps in a hand calculator, it would be:\n\n1) Recursively square root 10 times\n2) Subtract 1\n3) Multiply by 444.72\n\nThis gives you 2 dp accuracy for x < 10, which is all you need for the approximation anyway because we can apply the identity:\n\nlog_10 (a * 10^n ) = n + log_10 a\n\nSo e.g. log_10 (724) = 2 + log_10 (7.24). The approximation with 10 recursively square roots gives the correct result to 2dp.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards pals, appreciate them all :) \n\nAnother note - by tweaking OPs constant of 227697 to 227695, we can go from 4dp accuracy to 6dp accuracy!

Or is it just cost prohibitive?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to all who replied, I now have a much better understanding on this topic and have been, in my opinion, well informed by you all about the unacceptable risks of such a plan, the true costs involved, and some of the mechanics of spaceflight and astrophysics that make this whole idea unfeasible.

If we wanted to fire a rocket into the sun, we'd have to cancel all of that sideways velocity, which would take more energy than firing a rocket out of our solar system. \n\nSo why don't we just do that?\n\nFirstly, as you mentioned, there is the monetary cost. The voyager 1 and 2 missions, which are spacecrafts launched to exit our solar system, cost around [$865 million](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/voyager/fact-sheet/). Thus, the monetary cost is indeed prohibitive by many orders of magnitude. \n\nHowever, monetary cost is not the only ‚Äì nor even the most pressing ‚Äì consideration: If we spend more energy in the form of fuel on getting rid of the waste than we get out of the fission reaction in the first place, there is no point in doing the fission any longer, as the net-energy balance would be negative. We would be better off burning the fuel directly and cutting out the fission reactor. \n\nLastly, rockets explode way too often to risk transporting nuclear waste. Imagine a rocket exploding in the stratosphere, showering huge swaths of land with radioactive material. \n\nFor all these reasons, shooting nuclear waste into space is not feasible."}

To be fair, quantum entanglement is really hard to explain in an eli5 friend way, but a lot of the analogies people are using here are wrong and even more confusing.\n\nQuantum entanglement is when particles interact in such a way that their quantum states become linked so that you can't describe the particles individually. The result is that when you observe the state of one particle, you instantly know the state of the other, because they're intertwined. For example, if you measure one particle to have spin up, you instantly know the other particle is spin down. This occurs no matter how far away the particles are. The state isn't determined until you actually measure one of the particles. In other words, it's not as though one particle is spin up and the other is spin down, it's that both particles are in a superposition of both states until you measure one of them.\n\nHere's the part that trips people up (and don't feel bad because it is *not* at all intuitive), which is that you *cannot* use this to communicate faster than light because *no information is being transferred*. There's no causal relationship, it's merely a correlation. One particles isn't doing anything to the other in way that we can use. It only means that the next time you measure one particle, you know the states of both. You can't use this to communicate faster than light for 2 reasons. First is that the state you measure is random. So the particle could be spin up or spin down, you have no way of knowing which it's going to be, and thus no way of having a per-arranged code for any particular result means. The second is that only way to know whether your particle's state is determined is to measure it, but once you do that, you have no way of knowing if your particle took that state because *you* measured it or because someone else far away measured their corresponding particle. The only way to communicate that information is at or below light speed. \n\nSo really, to sum it all up, it's that particles have states that are intertwined in such a way that when you measure one, you know the state of the other."}

It's a useful way to manipulate people, and certainly a great banner to march behind; but when you analyze most \"religious\" wars and conflicts, they're actually about things like land, resources, power and so on.\n\nOf course, religion of sorts can be used as bait, and clueless people are often drawn into fighting battles for people they barely know on religion-based indoctrination. But what's interesting is that very often, these people, who are basically cannon fodder, know very little about the religion they think they're fighting for. In one case, some wannabe Jihadists were arrested, and among their possessions was a copy of *Islam for Dummies*.\n\nNazi Germany is a fascinating case. The question of whether Hitler was a Christian or not is one that has the potential to Godwin the debate in both directions: suffice to say that even his closest colleagues disagreed over this. But he did talk a lot about \"doing God's work\" in his speeches and in *Mein Kampf* -- which, incidentally, is all propaganda, so we can't rely on any of it being actually true. But one thing's for certain: he wanted people to *believe* he was religious, especially the Catholics, whose political wing he needed the support of in order to come to power in the first place. The evidence is that the Nazis' long-term aim was to get the religious folk of Germany on their side, then slowly replace Christian symbols with Nazi symbols, ending with basically a personality cult, with Hitler now the new Messiah.\n\nSo whether the Nazis' persecution of the Jews was motivated by religious or by racial sentiment is something that fundamentalist Christians and atheists can argue over. What is beyond doubt, though, is that the Nazis wanted to harness the general population's religious faith and turn it to their advantage."}

If you take a cross section of the rope you can see that it's made of a mixture of several smaller strands entwined together (muscle fibers). For the sake of simplicity, there are 2 types of smaller strand: skinny ones that aren't very strong but last a long time (type 1 fibers/slow twitch) and thicker powerful ones that wear out quickly (type 2 fibers/fast twitch).\n\nWhen these fibers contract force is produced. Slow twitch fibers produce the least force and fast twitch fibers the most. Therefore if you're lifting a light load for several repetitions then slow twitch fibers who don't produce a lot of force but have high endurance will do most of the work. If you're lifting a heavy load for a short duration  (~80% of your 1rm) you will need the help of those beastly type 2 fibers.  These bad boys not only produce more force but have greater potential for hypertrophy (grow bigger).\nSo, to answer your question- the difference in loading will affect what type of muscle fibers you recruit (ie, ones that can grow big or ones that can't get as big). \nTraining with low weights will help with endurance, heavy weights with strength.\n\nNow, there are several variables that contribute to muscles increasing in size. Muscles need a certain amount of volume (setxreps) to grow, so low volume-high weight workouts won't take advantage of stimulating maximal growth. Additionally, muscles can grow larger through means other than increasing the diameter of the muscle fiber (sarcoplasmic hypertrophy) which light weight, high reps take advantage of.\n\nBoth training parameters you mentioned can get you big in different ways, however to get strong like bull you need a heavy weight."}

Of course there would be error, but the apparent market of the illicit opiate abuse seems to dwarf the actual intended purpose.", "assistant": "Canadian pharmacist here.\n\nGetting opioid medications is a 2-step process: the physician needs to OK it, and the pharmacist needs to OK it. Both of these checkpoints are failing.\n\nFrom the physician's side:\n\nImagine you're a physician and a patient presents to you saying they are in pain (or has a bad cough.) Pain is very subjective so it's difficult to judge if they're lying or how much pain they are in. These people also tend to be very clingy and would refuse to leave your office until they get something. What do you do? You give them something hoping the pharmacist would stop them.\n\nThere are also other perspective the physician can take. They could consider it as harm-reduction (at least they're not using xxx.) They could be an irresponsible practionner (money is involved.) They could be working in a area with a high addict population; suddenly opioids become the norm and it's hard to judge what is abuse and what is common place.\n\nFrom the pharmacist's side:\n\nA patient arrives to the pharmacy. You have your doubts that the patient needs it, but the prescription is valid. Like the physician, the pharmacist really also don't want to deal with this BS: You want to get on with your day and move onto other patients; You want to make that patient leave ASAP; You want to make money; You consider it as a harm reduction approach. If you're a busy pharmacy processing 300 prescriptions a day, you don't have time to deal with this. if you're a slow pharmacy processing 50 prescriptions a day, you really need the money.\n\nIf you don't fill their prescription: They might attack you or threaten to be outside for you when you leave); They might rob you (robberies for narcotics are VERY common); They might sue you for discrimination; The physician might also get mad that you for not trusting them. One other common tactics that pharmacists use is to lie that they don't carry it. In this case, the prescription is handed back to them which only pushes the problem onto other pharmacists; they can easily find someone else to fill it for them.\n\nWhat doesn't have much repercussions is actually filling the medication. The prescriber has already OKed it and the adverse effects are well know. If the patient is abusing it or is harmed, everyone expected it so pharmacist doesn't really take the blame. Both the prescriber and the pharmacist know that they're only responsible for the medication itself. No one will take responsibility for addiction.\n\nIllegitimate ways to obtain prescription narcotics are actually very limited. Addicts would much rather illegal drugs over prescription drugs that are more difficult and expensive to obtain. Common strategies these people use are \"Double Doctoring\" - going to multiple prescribers to get multiple narcotic prescription; or \"Prescription Forgeries\" - faking/copying/editing a prescription. Physicians and pharmacists who get involved in this get into a lot of shit, so they are very careful and aren't afraid to call the patient out on it with strict laws behind them.\n\n**EDIT**:\n\nThere are a few questions concerning how we know a prescription is forged. There are a few safety measures/red flags:\n\n- Many pharmacies are equipped to automatically and instantly upload prescriptions online\n\n- Some pharmacies have a procedure to confirm with the prescriber for each one\n\n- Insurance companies instantly know if it has been filled\n\n- Some prescriptions require special paper for the prescription to be written on\n\nRed flags include:\n\n- The patient has never been to this pharmacy\n\n- The prescriber has never been documented at this pharmacy (they might be a legit prescriber, but far away; why would the patient travel so far)\n\n- The patient looks anxious/is lying/not cooperating with the pharmacist's questions/counselling\n\n- The hand written prescription is legible.\n\n**EDIT**: \n\nFirstly, I am an Albertan Canadian pharmacist. I have no ideas of the roles/laws outside of the province, let alone the US or other countries. Just to list off a few things Albertan pharmacists can do: independently prescribe any medication (except narcotics), independently adapt the strength, dose, formulation, regimen, type of drug, ect. for any medication, independently renew prescriptions, prescribe in an emergency, dispense for animals, administer vaccines, administer injections, develop care plans, order lab tests, refuse prescriptions. And we get paid for all of them. Yes, even the refusal. When a pharmacist make any change, they are a sole responsible prescriber. No, family physicians aren't happy.\n\nNow just because we CAN, doesn't mean we should/will. A responsible pharmacist will know when they are not competent enough and refer to someone else. This is like how although dentists are allowed to prescribe anything, they should stay within their scope. Pharmacists know the medications very well, but we're not the best at diagnosis, so we will still be referring to physicians for most ailments. Most pharmacist aren't comfortable with prescribing and will refer for most things. However, we are getting more comfortable with prescribing for minor ailments. Also, many pharmacists are also getting specializations for a specific field (eg. diabetes.)\n\nSecond, I am getting a lot of comments about it's not the pharmacist's business how to manage patient's prescription. This is absolutely false as this is literally our job description, especially in Canada and the US. When something goes wrong, both the pharmacist and the prescriber are equally responsible. ~~For many countries in the world, \"pharmacist\" are people straight of out high school with no higher education. In these cases, their role is very limited.~~ Looks like I'm completely wrong on this. Canadian and US pharmacists have a ~3-4 years of university professional degree, and for various reasons, we're paid literally 2-4 times more than pharmacists from most European countries (yes even the developed ones).\n\nOur job description: We make sure that your medications are indicated, effective, safe, and manageable. Indicated means that it's the right medication for the right condition for the right patient. Effective means that the dose/strength of medication is appropriate. Safe means that the benefits outweigh the potential harm. Manageable means that you can actually take the medication by the prescribe regimen - this includes addiction concerns.\n\nIf we do see a problem, we can either take care of it independently (and be the sole responsible prescriber) or contact the original prescriber to give a second opinion (this is why your prescriptions take so long, because we're always on ~~the phone~~ hold with the receptionist.) The prescriber can change the prescription and fax us a new one or cancel it completely. Nevertheless, we will contact everyone involved about the actions we took. No matter what happens, best practice states that the pharmacist must refer the patient to someone to can help them.\n\nExample 1:\nA family physician gave a patient a narcotic prescription. The pharmacist caught that the patient was double doctoring. The pharmacist refuses to fill. After the patient leaves, the pharmacist notifies all prescribers involved and all pharmacies involved to cancel the prescriptions.\n\nExample 2:\nA dentist gave an antibiotic prescription for a urinary tract infection. Although dentists are legally allowed to prescribe anything they want, this is not within their scope of practice. The pharmacist deems the dentist incompetent in the field and refuse the fill the prescription. The pharmacist refers the patient to a walk-in-clinic. The pharmacist then notifies the dentist.' NOTE: just because it's outside of their scope doesn't mean that we have to refuse. The dentist could be fully competent and assessed the patient appropriately, plus pharmacists also can assess the patient and confirm the dentist's prescription."}

But there are a lot of good reasons for IOT, especially in the industrial sector. Things like sensor on freight trains to measure the quality of the rails as they ride over, so that the rail company gets a real time map of infrastructure quality. Or sensors in remote oil drilling operations that can monitor sensitive components 24/7 so that as the component starts to show signs of failure (vibration, leaks, etc.) an operations center can send out a technician to repair it before it explodes and leaks oil everywhere."}

The answer to your question is very precise dosing.  A normal dose of fentanyl is 25-100 micrograms, which is an incredibly tiny amount.  At that dose you may feel a bit drowsy but it's very unlikely anything bad will happen.\n\nIt's easy to reliably give the right dose when you have drugs that are manufactured to strict standards and tested at multiple steps during production.  When you're mixing up drugs for street distribution, quality control gets pretty loose.  A variation of a few milligrams (a few thousand micrograms) one way or another is no big deal for many drugs, but would be lethal with fentanyl.\n\nAnother important factor is that patients receiving IV opioids are generally in a monitored setting so we know if their breathing slows down too much and can give them oxygen or even narcan.  If you're using recreational drugs alone or with a group of similarly intoxicated people, nobody will know you overdosed until too late."}

It seems sureal to me that a random element can indicate the date of another element. Google is giving complicated unmanageable answers.", "assistant": "Most carbon on Earth is carbon 12. A tiny amount is carbon 14. Carbon 12 is stable, whereas carbon 14 is radioactive - it decays into nitrogen 14 with a half-life of 5730 years. \n\nAll living organisms are constantly taking new carbon into our bodies as we consume things in the environment, whether that's eating, drinking, breathing...etc. So our bodies have mostly carbon 12 and a tiny amount of carbon 14. That carbon 14 decays into nitrogen, but we're constantly replenishing it because we're constantly taking in more carbon. \n\nOnce we die, we stop doing those things, so we stop taking new carbon into our bodies. That means as the carbon 14 decays, there's no new carbon 14 coming in to replace it. Since we know how fast carbon 14 decays, we can measure the ratio of carbon 14 to nitrogen 14 to find the time when that organism stopped taking in new carbon 14, or in other words, the time that organism died.\n\nCarbon dating only works back to about 60,000 years or so. Beyond that, there's just not enough carbon 14 left to get an accurate measurement. Carbon 14 also only works on organic material.

It is very good at recognizing patterns - when it notices that a certain pattern of input can lead to danger, it remembers that.  When that pattern crops up again, it can create a sense of unease - even if the logical conscious part of your brain hasn't noticed/made a connection.\n\nWithout your conscious brain even being notified, your body starts making preparations.

Its stated purpose is to reduce **tariffs** - taxes on bringing your goods into a country or sending them out - and therefore encourage industry by making it cheaper for importers and exporters to conduct business between these countries. Its other stated goal is to create a set of easy **rules** that businesses can live by when dealing between these countries.\n\nThe TPP is far more complex than that, however. Its subtextual function is to serve as a foundation from which to spread that set of easy rules to other Asian nations, with an eye to preventing China from setting standards among these countries first. The Obama administration is concerned that it's either \"us or them\" and that a Chinese-led trade agreement would set rules that American businesses would find problematic.\n\nSo what does it mean for you? Let's assume you are a citizen of one of the participating nations.\n\n‚Ä¢ A deal like the TPP involves identifying which tariffs affect **market access** and **competition** by creating a market that favors some producers over others instead of letting price, quality and consumer preference decide. For instance, it is very expensive to bring milk in to Canada, so even if you could sell your milk at a lower price, you will have to account for the cost of the tariffs, which will make your milk uncompetitive on the Canadian market. New Zealand and the US both want to see Canadian dairy tariffs lowered so that their milk producers can sell on the Canadian market more easily.\n\n‚Ä¢ When the market can decide and the barriers are down, we expect to see **open markets** offering **more products/services** than could previously have been made available. Prices should go down for certain products due to increased competition.\n\n‚Ä¢ A deal with as many players as the TPP rarely functions on one-to-one trades; instead, each party has a list of things that they want and needs to go shopping around to find ways to get their positions filled - a [chain of deals](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals) wherein, for instance, Japan pressures Canada on the milk issue so that they can in turn see motion on their own priority, such as car parts. This is why the negotiations have taken so long.\n\n‚Ä¢ The TPP wants to **standardize** rules for trade among its participants, which cover a lot more than just tariffs and quotas. Other issues that have to be considered and negotiated include intellectual property rights and protections; rules regarding patents; environmental and labor regulations. In short, it tries to set standards on **how business is conducted**, both internationally and at home. It does this because uneven practices can result in uncompetitive market access.\n\n‚Ä¢ This standardization is hoped to **improve labor and environmental laws** across the board, as the need to conform forces countries that have been lagging behind in their standards to catch up with the rest of the group. By setting rules that apply equally to the US as to Malaysia, it is hoped that **people will be better off** and enjoy more protections in their working environment.\n\n‚Ä¢ To that end, the TPP will also have a process in place for what happens when someone breaks the rules - a **tribunal** which will decide based on terms laid out by the TPP instead of following the laws of any one government. This helps ensure that foreign companies are treated fairly and can conduct business under the same standards and with the same opportunities.\n\n\n**Tl;dr the TPP is out to make business between these 12 countries more fair, predictable and even. It should provide more choice in goods and services and more bang for your buck, while making labor standards improve for people outside of North America who may be operating under less protections than a Canadian or American enjoys.**\n\n---\nWhat are some concerns?\n---\n\n‚Ä¢ The TPP has been negotiated in **heavy secrecy**. While it's easy to see why keeping such a huge deal secret from the public is problematic, it is also reasonable for governments to work on negotiations and come to terms before letting elected officials decide if the end result is in the public interest. It lets others at the bargaining table know that what is said there won't be changed by a public opinion poll two days later, and it has been argued that such secrecy is therefore necessary to make these meetings work at all.\n\n‚Ä¢ The TPP has a **scope** that concerns many parties as it addresses trade and industry regulations on a 21st century scope - everything from upcoming cancer drugs to internet regulations to, yes, a cup of milk in Canada is all being covered by the same negotiation. It is a reasonable concern to say that the number of issues being covered in the same deal will make it hard for the public to reasonably read, understand and decide on.\n\n‚Ä¢ The removal of tariffs provides new foreign opportunities for business, but it also means that industries which rely on a **protected domestic market** will become exposed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that any given country is trading away the success of industry A for success in industry B, which, if all things are equal, should come down to a zero-sum game. Economics does not, of course, work like that, but it's still a fair question to examine.\n\n‚Ä¢ While supporters of the TPP say that it will encourage countries to improve their standards and reform, those elements are at their strongest during the negotiation - and the heat on issues such as human trafficking and human rights abuses have been sidelined as pressure to secure a deal of any kind has mounted on major nations facing upcoming elections. What should have been an opportunity to engage and demand reform as a condition of involvement in such a major global trade deal has been left by the wayside, a casualty of ambition.\n\n---\nWhat are the serious issues?\n---\n\n‚Ä¢ While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, **large corporate interests** have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an **obligation** to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.\n\n‚Ä¢ \"Free trade\" as the TPP proposes is **nothing new** - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to **move jobs** and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.\n\n‚Ä¢ There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves **exceptions** in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those **standards lowered** - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business. \n\n‚Ä¢ Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - **jobs** - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.\n\n‚Ä¢ The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are **harsher than existing law**, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.\n\n‚Ä¢ More damagingly, the TPP **applies those laws to drugs** with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights **should** be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.\n\n‚Ä¢ The TPP will offer a method by which companies can **attack laws that affect them**, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.\n\n‚Ä¢ We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we're committed to an **all-or-nothing deal**.\n\n**Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It's being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.**\n\nAnyone with questions, comments, concerns, let me know here or via PM and I'll be happy to help."}

It is composed of mainly part time soldiers who work regular jobs and then go on exercises. This allows the national guard to have a lot of soldiers ready to serve without spending much tax payer money or draining the countries workforce. In the event that the army or air force require more personnel they can call on the national guard and get people who have been through basic training and have kept up with their training but who may not be as prepared as the full time service members.\n\nIn addition to this the national guard can serve as a militia force. In the event that the conventional forces are overrun and land fall into enemy control the national guard can activate in those areas to conduct operations behind enemy lines. This is similar to the marines but with the benefit of home advantage there are lots of different tactics that needs to be employed.\n\nIn the US the national guard is a much smaller part of the military then in most other countries. If I interpret the numbers correctly the national guard is roughly the same size as the army. But it is much more common to have a ten to one ratio, with most of the funds still going to the army. For example the Russian invasion of Ukraine were largely done by the national guard instead of the standing army. Similarly the current Israeli invasion of Gaza heavily rely on the national guard."}

I‚Äôm a food scientist, and to address your concern about the cookie dough specifically, cookie dough is labeled with warnings not necessarily because of the eggs (although there will always be concerns with raw poultry products and salmonella), but because of the flour. \n\nThink of it this way. Flour is a processed grain that is essentially taken from the field and ground into flour by mechanical means. While there are other steps sometimes involved (whole wheat flour vs. regular flour, cake flour vs. regular flour all involve different processing steps), the flour is not taken through enough steps during processing that can guarantee pathogens of concern are killed. So, bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, etc. can be introduced in the field or during processing, meaning it can end up ground right in the final flour. \n\nHowever, this does not mean you should be scared of flour now. Flour is not a product typically eaten raw (ie. You don‚Äôt eat flour with a spoon), and almost everything you make with it will go through a significant heat kill step (baking, cooking, etc.), AKA you are getting rid of the bacteria. \n\nThis leads to why manufacturers put the warning on cookie dough. People enjoy raw cookie dough, so they are at risk of eating raw flour. \n\nYes, salmonella may exist in the cookie dough. Will it hurt you? No, not likely unless you are a person with a weakened immune system susceptible to foodborne illness (meaning it essentially takes less bacteria to make you sick because your body is not as well equipped to protect itself), or the cookie dough was temperature abused (meaning the cookie dough was not properly refrigerated, leading the cookie dough reaching an internal temperature that allows the bacteria to multiply more quickly, and more bacteria=more of a chance at getting sick).\n\nEDIT: Here‚Äôs a succinct source from the FDA for those interested in this cookie dough info:\n\n[FDA Cookie Dough Guidance ](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/raw-doughs-raw-deal-and-could-make-you-sick)"}

In particular, how can you possibly observe an object with a value less than 1? Does say, 0.5 represent the absence of the other half of something rather than the actual value of the object? I say this because in my mind if 1 is something and 0 is nothing then whatever is between 0 and 1 seems inconceivable.

And what is one apple? Is there any definition of what the one apple should be? Of course not but it's much easier for us to say that you have two apples. Integers are invented to make our interactions easier.\n\nAlso, 0.5 is just a decimal representation of numbers. Say, if you have three apples it's easier to take one third.

It seems like it would be akin to a wrecking ball vs. a car. Is it the same reasoning as the falling explanation?", "assistant": "Multiple reasons:\n\nThe exoskeleton of the ant distributes the force more quickly across its entire body (due to being more stiff than fluffy human tissue), protecting more vulnerable parts.\n\nThe small size makes it more resistant to blows - this is because volume (and mass) scales faster than surface area (r^3 instead of r^2). So smaller objects have a larger surface area per unit mass, which makes them move more easily even with light forces (like wind). The mass is what causes inertia (\"pushing back\" against your finger while you apply the force) and the force is distributed over its surface area. So your applied force is distributed across a relatively large (compared to its volume) surface area (leading to a relatively low pressure), while the low mass (very low, due to aforementioned scaling) makes it easy to move. This means you won't be applying your force for more than a fraction of a second before the ant is moving along with your finger, no longer receiving any significant force. Since you're not applying this force over any time (or distance), the total energy transferred into the ant is very small. This, combined with the effective armor exoskeleton, is why it's difficult to kill insects by swatting them into empty space, but if you push them against a solid object, they squash easily.\n\nTL;DR: Resistant exoskeletons and general properties of small objects make them less likely to be crushed by an outside force.\n\nTrue ELI5: It's like trying to break a balloon by punching it in midair. The punch is certainly hard enough, but the balloon just kind of gets pushed away.\n\n*edit: spelling*\n\n*edit2: added true ELI5*"}

This is what makes it good at avoiding interference.  \n   \nCoax cables are typically used for radio-frequency (RF) signals. This is what allows cable TV or internet with a lot of information to work. The information modulates (changes) a high-frequency carrier which comes into a modulator/demodulator (modem), where it can be demodulated and sent on to a router or whatever. \n   \nIf you don't have the coax signal coming into your modem, then it has to get there some other way such as fiber.  \n   \nSome houses also have coax running to various rooms.

I know it has something to do with complex numbers but the explanations out there are too confusing for me.", "assistant": "So it basically depends on the how you define infinite sums. \n\nFor example, if we take a look at the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + .... then we can see (and can prove) that as we add more and more elements, the sum becomes closer and closer to 2, so we say is converges to 2. Meanwhile, if we look at the series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ... then as we add more and more elements, the sum just keeps rising and rising infinitely (even though every element we add it smaller and smaller), so we say this is a divergent series. Another thing is that if we have two series that converge to a limit, we can perform some arithmetic between them, for example if one series converges to 2 and another series converges to 3, then their sum (i.e. taking one element from each series at a time) will converge to 2+3 = 5.\n\nNow let's take a look at this infinite series: 1-1+1-1+1-1...\n\nThe sum fluctuates between 1 and 0, so we can't say it converges to any single number, ergo this is also a divergent series. But what if we extend our definition of convergence, to say that in this case, the series converges to 1/2 (the average between 0 and 1)? This is the result of something called [Ramanujan summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan_summation) and allows us to calculate the sum of series that are usually divergent. The Ramanujan summation gives the same results if you use it on a series that converges normally, but if the series diverges then it can also gives us a finite sum - specifically, the series 1+2+3+4+... converges to -1/12.

In the process of soap making, you turn fats (not water soluble) into detergents by changing their main functional group into what's basically a salt, turning them in to what is called an \"amphiphilic\" compound, which means it has one end that likes water (hydrophilic) and one end that likes fats (hydrophobic). Now, that detergent will attract fats with its hydrophobic end and dissolve them in water using its hydrophilic end.\n\nThe most basic way to do this is to mix a triglyceride fat like tallow with lye (NaOH), though modern soaps are a bit more sophisticated (soaphisticated?)\n\nEdit: just realized I misread the question, thought you were asking why soaps are made from fats if they remove fats.

So, explain it like I'm five, please!", "assistant": "There are two answers to this, and they deal with primarily biology and legality.\n\nFood preserved in cans and in means that seal packaging typically keep out bacterial and enzymatic action. The canning process pasteurizes them and makes them shelf stable. Things like oxygen and the reintroduction of bacteria accelerate and repermit the spoilage of food. With other means, like cheese, cutting into the rind removes the protective layer. \n\nThe second point is legality. Any country with an active food regulatory system requires that you give dates for consumption. Many countries have a distinction between Best by vs and expiration date. One indicates peak of freshness (very common for cheeses, for example), and the other is the end of the date that you should consume it. \n\nThat said, many of the dates given are often relatively arbitrary. I had some century eggs that said to be refrigerated and expired just a couple months after production, but century eggs are known to keep a very long time under pantry conditions. That's actually the point. The expiration date on that is more of checking a legal box than giving a real projection. \n\nThe long and the short of it is that we are spoiled by having preservation methods, but when you break that seal, the thing is no longer preserved. Beyond that, we are blessed enough to have food systems that want to make sure we aren't consuming spoiled food, so sometimes that means that they are excessively strict. The thing to keep in mind with all of this is that food spoilage is actually the norm. Humans have brilliantly come up with a thousand ways to have food all year round."}

As a consequence if you just had a single firearm and fired it at a distant enemy, chances are you would completely miss your target. Massing infantry together was partly intended to make their firing effective through sheer volume; *someone* would hit *something* when you have an entire line of people firing at once.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that such weapons were very slow to reload. It was expected that a standard infantryman could fire their weapon twice a minute, and a good one perhaps three times. If you have a lone infantryman in a field shooting once every 30 seconds with horrible accuracy then it is relatively easy to just send a few guys over to stab them with a spear or whatever. By keeping the infantry together in a big bunch they could use their long firearms with bayonets to function like traditional spear formations, deterring people just charging them with melee weapons.\n\nFinally it was likely a requirement of organization and coordination of military units to keep them together in some kind of orderly bunch. There weren't radios or anything and some nobleman shouting orders to a bunch of peasants free to hide in ditches or scatter into the trees was likely to end up with half the force deserting and the other half not firing a shot.

They claim the radio active injections is only local action and doesnt harm the rhinos and is much better than the currently prevalant approach of sawing off the horns before poachers get to them. Rhinos need their horns for their own survival too so existing approach was never sustainable. I am wondering how this works with lead shielding?

Why is 2% of my savings disappearing every year good?  (In ideal case)", "assistant": "Consider the alternate case: deflation (negative inflation). Money gains value automatically, just by sitting there. Thing is? This is a *guaranteed safe investment.* You haven't given the money to anyone, not even a bank, so it's not possible for you to lose the money unless it's *stolen* from you. Hence, the best investment choice quickly becomes \"never spend money.\" That causes the economy to grind to a halt. This can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: people stop buying, causing demand to drop, which causes prices to drop to try to make SOME kind of sale, which means the currency has deflated even more, which means demand drops, which means... etc.\n\nOf course, the reverse direction, excessive inflation or even hyperinflation, is also very bad. That ruins the value of the currency so quickly, economic activity ceases to be relevant, and folks revert to barter economy or find other mediums of exchange instead.\n\nHowever, if you keep inflation very low *but not negative*, people have a reason to invest (their money will slowly lose value if they just sit on it) without being TOO badly punished by that incentive (the money only loses value very slowly). Suddenly, everyone is spurred to invest, to seek the best employment opportunities they can get, to spend what money they need to spend *now* and to look for better returns on what money they intend to hold onto.\n\nThat's why *small* amounts of inflation are good. They create an incentive (invest so your money doesn't dwindle) without creating a counter penalty (it's realistically plausible for your money to grow fast enough to exceed inflation).\n\nEdit: Also, debt becomes SIGNIFICANTLY worse under deflation. If you owe $1000, then that means the value of your debt goes up on its own, which is then compounded by interest. That's very bad and can lead to many defaults and other issues."}

Europeans (and Asians) did have strong oxen and horses to pull carts, and so they were more able to advance in this area.  This technology improved other aspects of their lives; because they could ship food more easily, they could sustain higher populations, and also have a more urbanized population.  Because of the division of labor this afforded, European peoples were able to prosper in many other areas of technological development, whereas the Mayans (and other Mesoamerican populations) had to devote more time and resources towards food production.\n\nTL;DR - the Europeans had horses and oxen, which made food production more efficient and allowed for a greater and more urban population.

Well unless you live in the African savannah, it's very unlikely to be a zebra.  We'd need more assumptions to get there - a zebra was imported to a local zoo, it escaped captivity, and now it's running amok.  Whereas a horse requires just one assumption - a horse is nearby.  That doesn't mean that it *cannot* be a zebra, it just means that you should start at \"it's probably a horse\" and investigate from there.\n\nI had a fun moment the other day, when I went to my kitchen and saw a jar of pickles left out on the counter.  I knew it wasn't me, which left two possibilities that my brain somehow jumped to:\n\n1. A burglar broke in, stole several other items, and *also* ate a pickle.  He left the jar out to taunt me.\n2. My wife had a pickle and then forgot to put away the jar.\n\nI could have totally checked my locks, made sure my valuables were still in the right place, etc.  Instead I just yelled \"Hey, did you leave this pickle jar out?\" and got the simpler answer right away.  Starting with the simpler solution (fewer assumptions than my burglar story) got me to the right answer efficiently.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards!  For the dozen or so people who have commented to imply that my wife is pregnant, I just want it to be known: we are a pro-pickle family.  They go perfectly next to a nice sandwich for lunch, or diced up in a tuna salad.  Jars of pickles go reasonably fast in this household, no cause for alarm."}

They always make sure to give you the option to remove ads with a small fee - which appeals to our human need to remove a ‚Äòpain point‚Äô (an inbuilt aspect in many free to play mobile games that slows down the player or tries to push them towards making paid purchases - these include things like in-game wait timers). \n\n(3) That other major way they make money is buy selling your user data to other third parties (businesses) as user data is an extremely powerful tool for companies to have because it allows them to understand you and how to market and target you as a customer."}

Instead of putting the water into a freezer and cooling it with air they spray/pour water directly on the coils of the freezer. This makes it form in a bunch of thin and quickly formed layers, instead of as one thick chunk which is frozen slowly over dozens of minutes. \n\nWhen ice is formed in a big chunk it freezes from the outside in. So a layer on the outside forms, and then the inside of it is stopped from expanding and can't push itself out, which makes a bunch of stress lines/fractures throughout the cube. This is also why ice cubes from your freezer will 'pop' or sometimes explode when it's melting in your glass.\n\nNone of this happens when the ice is formed in layers from one direction because the water has room to expand."}

What affects it?", "assistant": "On average, guys ejaculate about 1 teaspoon-worth of semen in one ejaculation - about 5 mL - which is not a large amount.   The amount (volume) of ejaculate will be a little more if it's been awhile since you ejaculated and less if you ejaculated recently.\n\nA man's body is constantly producing sperm and storing it up for ejaculation.  This gets mixed with fluid produced by the seminal vesicles and prostate.  Apart from frequency of ejaculation, the amount of time spent in sexual activity and the amount of arousal can also affect the volume of ejaculate.  The longer the build-up, arousal, and direct stimulation prior to ejaculation, the more volume of fluid can be produced to mix with sperm for ejaculation.  Some men also have noticed that this increase in ejaculate volume with longer stimulation also produces a waterier semen because of the increased fluid to sperm ratio.\n\nSo it stands to reason that if you are dehydrated, your volume will probably be less.  Other factors that affect it are getting proper amounts of zinc in your diet, getting good sleep, stress levels and your frequency of ejaculation.  Genetic factors and age also play a part, but those are not under your control.  Strengthening your PC muscles can produce stronger contractions on orgasm and help push out more fluid."}

Now, every time the dollar is spent, the government makes 8 cents (or whatever your sales tax is) or maybe 25 cents (if it's used to pay an employee), but the dollar itself circulates and keeps the economy going. So if you physically destroy this dollar, what is the economic effect? Extend this further to say $100, or $10,000.

Only the red is distinct.\n\nWhy is this the case? wouldn't you be able to see blue and green even if the room wasn't super-bright?", "assistant": "Whether you can see a color on a surface depends on if photons with the wavelength that correspond to that color are reflected from that surface into your eyes. I presume a dark poker room is not totally dark, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see anything. Instead it could be that the room is lit with warm yellowish-reddish light. This light has more red light than green or blue light. That would lead to red surfaces reflecting a lot of light and blue or green surfaces from reflecting a little to no light. This makes red surfaces pop and blue or green surfaces appear darker or even black.\n\nThere is also the case of your brain trying to maximise contrast in low light conditions and your eyes having two different types of receptors for colors and just light and dark (cones and rods), but I think the lighting conditions where there is more red than green or blue light is the more likely explanation."}

Errors occasionally crop up in cellular division. Normally, a sperm has either a X or Y chromosome. Sometimes, when the sperm divide, they can get XY, YY, XX, or no sex chromosome at all.

You can even have more (XXXY).\n\nPeople with these genetic oddities don't always exhibit symptoms that are noteworthy. Some can even have kids. It's all about the hormones released at certain points of development and how the person develops. \n\nSome woman are insensitive to the male hormones (like androgen) that the SRY gene on the Y chromosome causes. They are XY, but they don't respond to the hormones that would cause male genitalia to form.

How does this work?\n\nI know that some planes, particularly in the US, have WiFi.\n\nMy understanding for why we have airplane mode on phones, is to not interfere with the pilot. How does WiFi on airplanes work? How does it not impact the pilot/plane?", "assistant": "There are several reasons for not having phones enabled on planes, and the balance of reasons and outcome has changed over time.  \n\nFirst, the GSM (cellular phone) radio: as the plane is taking off and landing, generally low over urban areas, particularly in the US, where cellular base station (tower) deployments were historically much sparser (and thus higher-powered / longer reach) than in Europe where GSM was developed, phones in planes would be simultaneously visible to many towers, which was outside the design parameters of how tower-to-tower roaming handoff was designed to work, and could eat up a lot of resources on the cellular network side. So at first the thinking there was that it was better if nobody did that, and then the thinking was that it was better if those scarce resources were societally prioritized for private aviation pilots, who were most likely to need them.  Then the technology improved, and it stopped really being an issue. \n\nSecond, some people pay a lot of money to be on planes. Those are the people with business-class tickets, who are collectively footing the bill for the fuel to make the plane go. The folks in back don‚Äôt actually contribute much to the airline‚Äôs margin. People pay for business class, rather than just leaving earlier and returning later and getting more nights in hotels, so they can sleep. The last thing someone in business wants is to be unable to sleep because some idiot is yakking on their phone. \n\nThird, as other people have hinted, and related to the first reason, was RF safety. As a phone gets further from a tower, it has to jack up its transmission wattage to maintain the connection.  That can actually be a fair bit of power, in frequencies planes‚Äô electronic systems hadn‚Äôt been designed or tested for.  Again, this gradually became less of an issue: phone manufacturers became more conservative in how they burn through your battery, aircraft manufacturers began to recognize this as a condition they should test for, and cellular network operators became smarter about how they allowed phones to maintain connections to multiple towers. \n\nNONE of which have to do with WiFi, which wasn‚Äôt an issue on planes before airlines were ready for it to be, because there was nothing for a user to connect to over WiFi.  Now that airlines have a service to sell over WiFi, they do so."}

What advantage is there to more or less blades?\n\nAn actual question my five year old asked me and I couldn't answer, please help!", "assistant": "It's always a balance.\n\nNumber of blades:\n\n* Fewer blades = More efficient shoveling of air because of turbulence (air swirls) created by other blades reduces efficiency. Usually simpler to make.\n* More blades = More stable because the force is spread out over more blades and shovels more air compared to how long the propellers are.\n\nPropeller tips breaking sound barrier is bad (because of lots of turbulence). The longer the propeller the faster the tips go compared to the center. But having too short blades means more loss of energy at the blade tips:\n\n* Longer blades = Better at generating lift, shoveling more air at lower speeds. Longer propellers also less stable and vibrate more.\n* Smaller blades = Allows higher top speeds since the propeller can go much faster without breaking the soundbarrier with the wingtips. More stable.\n\nSo basicly.WW1 airplane: We can't make so good engines. So we're gonna go with efficient short two-bladed propellers because that gives is the most thrust for our weak engines.\n\nWW2 airplane: We gots a lot better engines now. But two-bladed propellers can't shovel enough air to take our planes as fast as we're going to go. So we're going to go with 4 short blades!\n\nHelicopter: We gotta generate lots of lift. So we're going to go with longer and slower rotating blades!\n\nModern helicopter: Uh. Those blades aren't generating enough lift. MORE BLADES! More blades is harder to make, but more stable too.\n\nModern turboprop: Too noisy! We're making special 6 bladed propellers that are much quieter. And computer power and advanced materials allows us to make them special advanced shapes that generate even less noise and more power. So now they look more like ship propellers. But for air! Still kinda short blades because we gotta go fast!\n\nShip propellers: Water dense yo. So we gotta make blades short (or they'll break!) but we make them much wider to shovel a lot of water backwards.\n\nP.S: Jet engines work entirely differently, even if they do have fans at the front they're for compressing air into the engine, not generating thrust.  \n\n\nP.P.S: For ceiling fan. You're moving lots of air, but you want to do it slowly and silently. So lots of wide blades. How long the blades are depends on how mobile you want the fan to be. Big fan = more air silently. Small fan = Noisier, but more mobile."}

But the supercontinents back then could really have amplified weather conditions.*\n\n\\---\n\nThe level of oxygen wasn't really that much of a factor. Oxygen levels were higher because plants were sucking all of the carbon dioxide out of the air and trapping the carbon into coal and oil at the time while breathing out oxygen and raising the levels up to about 30%. (It's 21% or so now). That much higher level would have made fires way more dangerous in dry areas like grasslands with lots of fuel. Large fires can contribute some to weather, but they usually don't amplify storms in general.\n\nThe biggest influence was continental structure. We had two different supercontinent-type land formations back then, Pangaea around 300 million years ago broke into two big chunks, Laurasia and Gondwana, during the time of the dinosaurs.\n\nNow very generally speaking, the more you pack land into one area and ocean into the other, the greater the general impact on weather... and with supercontinents leaving gigantic stretches of ocean pretty much wide open, you're going to get this to happen. This is because hurricanes feed off of warmer water and shrink when they cross land, and when there's more warm water, there's bigger hurricanes or typhoons (and this is why Pacific storms are often larger than Atlantic ones).\n\nOther storms can get amplified too. Nor'easters (the big storms we get here on the NorthEastern coast of North America) build off of differences in air pressure which are caused by differences in heat level. . Larger masses of solar-heated continuous land mean greater regional heating, and that can translate to differences in regional pressure colliding with each other and generating much more powerful localized storms.\n\nThere's a number of other factors including sea depth (shallower seas warm up more), mountains that deflect currents of air, ocean currents (that help to convey warm and cold weather and equalize temperatures), and distribution of land versus water at the equator where the most solar energy is focused. All of this stuff is why it's hard to talk about specifics back then.\n\nBut in general,  you could expect to get truly massive storms crossing over the coasts of the supercontinents in this altered world.\n\n(made a few edits for completeness and to correct one error)"}

Given that most of the health problems in the US revolve around obesity and its consequences, though, docs are very likely to recommend exercise. \n\nCould all of this change? It sure could! Could some forms of chemical stress on the heart be good for it? Probably! But in the meantime, I'll tell you the same things I tell everyone: get some exercise and avoid stress. Life just feels better when you do that stuff. \n\nAnd everyone here who pulls out a study showing one finding or another: I can probably find a study showing the opposite.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold!\nEdit: 3 years later, there is a very good study suggesting that vigorous exercise **is truly beneficial** for overall mortality. I eat some of my words above, as this is truly a high-quality and large study.

So long as air is moving over wings fast enough the plane will fly. The engines are what generate thrust, causing the plane move forward.\n\nA wings shape causes air over the wing to have lower pressure than the air beneath the wing, this pressure difference causes the wing to be pushed up.\n\nThere is a classic experiment at home to show you the basics of how it works. Hold a sheet of paper in front of your mouth so that it's hanging loosely and blow over the top side. The sheet should lift up. This is called the Bernoulli principle.\n\nIf the engines were to stop the plane will continue to fly (glide) for a while because a plane is still moving forward. There's usually more than enough time and distance for the plane to land, but the chances of a plane losing all of its engines is very unlikely.\n\nMore importantly this is why planes often have more than 1 engine, and why they are so far apart. If one gets damaged the other will probably be ok. Planes can fly on just 1 engine.\n\nAs for safety, airplanes are the safest way to travel.\n\nThere's a lot of maintenance, inspections, redundancies, and rules the airline industry has to follow to keep them safe. Parts have to be inspected and replaced at regular intervals whether they are working or not to make sure they are in top condition. \n\nThis may not bring you much comfort, but you are something like 85 times more likely to die in a car accident in the cab on the way to the airport than in the plane. Planes are perfectly safe, and much much safer than cars. You drive in a car probably everyday and you know they are pretty safe, and planes are far safer than cars.\n\nPilots and mechanics do pre-flight inspections on everything and have like a million sensors on the plane. When the start it if something is wrong, they can shut it down and fix it before they take off.\n\nTurbulence is to planes as bumps in the road are to cars.

But I have learned a lot so thanks for the responses. This Seinfeld scene pretty much sums up this thread perfectly (courtesy of /u/mac-0 )  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ", "assistant": "You're getting a lot of different answers here, and most are correct but people here are talking about cash donations.  There's another big type of donation that rich people make too and that's in illiquid/non-marketable assets such as real estate and/or shares in private companies.\n\nThe ELI5 is a little difficult, but the gist is that for private companies, getting a 'value' is about 99% art and 1% science.  Accounting is a lot more assumptions and guess work than people would like to publicly acknowledge.  \n\nSo what an individual can do is offer to donate, say, 10% of his company to a charity.  Let's say that the company did really well last year so that guy can easily find an accountant to say that 10% is worth $10M. So the guy has a $10M tax deduction he can use as he sees fit (subject to AMT and other shit, but you get the point).  The guy also knows that last year's performance was a blip and if he repeated that 10% donation this year, he'd only get a valuation of $5M.  In effect he's got an extra $5M from the valuation.  \n\nWhen I was younger, I was on the young alumni board for the university I went to for undergrad and we used to see this all the time.  Someone would donate property/illiquid securities/art/etc with an 'assessed' value of (say) $10M, but when the school went to sell it, they'd only realize (say) $3M in cash.  But the guy would still get to keep the $10M tax deduction. To a guy like that, a $10M tax deduction could be worth $4m to $5M easily.\n\nI'm sure you're wondering, and yes this is in that 'gray zone' that's just millimeters from being tax fraud.  However, the IRS rarely pursues these cases 1) because they are *really* hard to win, 2) the school doesn't really care b/c they still just got a $3M donation, and 3) the school isn't going to 'help' the IRS (beyond bare minimum compliance) b/c the school would have to give up the $3M.\n\nA similar, but different, application of this idea is where Mitt Romney reported a [$102M IRA](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/whats-really-going-on-with-mitt-romneys-102-million-ira/261500/) by having accounts toy with the value/valuation of the assets within the IRA.  There's no reasonable way you could ever get that much into an IRA....unless you got your accountants to depress the value first then re-value later.\n\n***EDIT:*** I'm getting a lot of questions about how this worked for Romney.  Here is a *purely hypothetical* example based loosely on when Bain Capital took out Domino's Pizza that I put in a lower comment - I'm putting it here so more people see it:\n\nI'm going to make up the exact numbers, but this is the mechanics: Romney had a type of retirement account where you could but $30K cash per year in the account tax free. He also had a private equity firm invested in private companies.\n\nRomney took $30K cash, put it in the retirement account each year - tax free. Each year, his accountants would say, 0.X% of your portfolio companies is magically equal to $30K, so Romney would take the $30K cash in the tax-sheltered IRA and buy 0.X% of his companies personally. He did this for about (I think) 15 years. After a while, he converted it to a ROTH IRA meaning that he'd pay a small one-time tax hit but withdrawals are tax free.\n\nLater on, his private equity company would sell the individual companies that it owned (or take them public). When they were sold, Romney would recognize the gain BUT it was now within the tax-sheltered IRA he'd pay no taxes and because he converted to a ROTH IRA, he pays no taxes on withdrawals. Genius.\n\nHere's a sort of hypothetical example. In 1998, Bain (Romney's PE company) bought Dominos Pizza for $1.1B. They probably used a standard PE structure meaning that they borrowed $1.0B and put down cash for $100M. So the company is $1.0B debt and $100M equity. Romney puts in $30K each year to buy some of Dominos ($30K/$100M = .03%/year). He buys .03% per year, for a total of .45% of Dominos after 15 years. At this point, he converts from a traditional IRA to a ROTH IRA paying roughly $100K in taxes ($450K in contributions multiplied by his tax rate at the time of the conversion - maybe a little more or less than $100K, but in the neighborhood).\n\nThen they take Dominos public, which they did. Dominos is worth $10B as of right now, so Romney's 0.45% of Dominos would be worth $45M. ***All completely tax free*** because its in a ROTH.\n\nIn reality, he has an IRA worth $102M, so my example is off by about half, but you get the basic mechanics. The IRS looked at it and said it was aggressive but not illegal when he ran for president in 2012."}

However, this applies to most [chargers](http://i.imgur.com/zrPuH.jpg).\n\nA wall charger is basically three components (before someone start to bash on me, I understand modern switching setup may have different designs, but understand this is ELI5).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. A step down converter (convert 100-240V to something like 7-9V)  \n2. A AC-DC converter (Wall electricity to battery like electricity)  \n3. A regulator  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, you have 3 components, with different roles that work together.  \n\nElectricity coming from the wall (also called \"Main\") has to be converted from its original state, which is \"vibrating\" at 50-60 hertz and could be anywhere from 100V to 260V (main is actually not regulated, so it may vary a little during the day, and depending the area you are). To give you a rough idea what 60hz is, it's the ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ sound an old neon makes.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is much easier to work with smaller voltages than high voltages, specially when confined in the small area of a wall charger. Since we want to end with low voltage, we start that way to simplify the rest of the circuit. That is the job of the step down converter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce the step down converter has lowered the voltage to something, say, 7-9 volts, we want to turn the AC (vibrating) electricity to DC (continuous). This is usually done by a single inexpensive part.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOnce we have low voltage DC power, we simply need to regulate it. This is where the regulator comes in. The job of this part is to control the flow of electricity in order to maintain a constant voltage  (5V in our case) across load. This means that regardless if your phone is connected or not, the output of the wall charger will \"always\" be 5V.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, to answer your question, if you leave your charger disconnected, your regulator simply keep a 5V on it, wasting a ridiculously tiny amount of electricity (1-5 cent a year depending the pricing of electricity in your area). Some smart chargers may have a sleep mode, turning themselves off completely unless connected. Regardless, a properly designed wall charger will never suffer any damage from staying disconnected.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome people have asked what was the whistle that could be heard when the phone was full or disconnected from the charger. This is what we call \"coil whine\". Basically, a switching regulator works by pulsing electricity through a coil, which create an magnetic field. Under very low load, the pulse becomes \"slower\" (simplified), which makes the coil vibrate in a frequency we can hear. High quality manifacturers will fix that by gluing the coil during assembly, or using a higher frequency regulator. Regardless, this is not an indicative of a failing device, you can still use it without any issue.  \n\nBTW, this is my first comment on ELI5, I hope it's clear enough."}

For example; how do you get an HCG out of a blood test? Or any other values liiike cholesterol or lipid or other‚Ä¶ stuff you get from analysis of blood. \n\nI asked an ER doctor friend and they said something along the lines of it‚Äôs lab magic, they just press a button on the computer and there‚Äôs the results. I tried googling and well‚Ä¶ that was a dead end but maybe my phrasing wasn‚Äôt great.", "assistant": "I‚Äôm a biomedical scientist in the UK working in the chemistry and the way I always explain it:\n\nWe spin your sample really fast in a centrifuge. This makes all the heavy red cells fall to the bottom and you‚Äôre left with the liquid - this is your plasma or serum (this depends on the colour tube they‚Äôve taken from you!). Plasma samples contain an anticoagulant to stop the blood from clotting, whereas serum is everything left once your blood clotted. \n\nWe then take that liquid portion and put it through our analysers. They work on a principle called spectrophotometry. There is an equation called Beers Law which in simple terms means that the light absorbance of a substance is proportional to the amount of the substance over a defined interval. \n\nTo picture this, imagine you have some orange juice. If I dilute the orange juice, the colour of the diluted drink will be less orange. If I dilute it again, it will be even less orange. Our analysers use light to test the amount of ‚Äúorange‚Äù in a sample, and using Beers law can then work out the exact concentration of orange. Now replace orange with what you‚Äôre looking for in the blood. \n\nThen we look at the number that was produced and check that it is expected, it wasn‚Äôt impacted by any contaminants (if the person who drew your blood was naughty and took different tubes in the wrong order, or from an IV line), it‚Äôs not haemolysed (the blood cells broke apart from being taken using a high gauge needle or poor technique, this sends lots of red pigment into the plasma or serum which interferes with that ‚Äúorange‚Äù we‚Äôre looking for). We can then give those results to the doctor, and if they‚Äôre critically abnormal we might ring the doctor to give a heads up. \n\nThere‚Äôs lots of different types of spectrophotometry, and things like hormones/HCG use bound antibodies to give fluorescence (a type of light we can measure) but they all kinda work the same way. \n\nOver in the haematology lab they will be using flow cytometry which uses light scatter to work out how many and the type of cells you have in your blood. If they see abnormal distributions they will then smear some blood on a glass slide and look at it under a microscope to see if there are any nasty looking cells, this can indicate a whole range of things from iron deficiency, leukaemias and even genetic diseases such as sickle cell! Again, once they‚Äôve decided that your results are valid, this will go onto a report which is checked before sending back to the requesting clinician."}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: How does NA beer work\n\nMost NA beers claim to have less then.5% alcohol Heineken claims to have 0% alcohol what is the difference in brewing methods?", "assistant": "The exact rules will vary by jurisdiction as \"non-alcoholic\" and \"alcohol free\" are legal terms in this usage.\n\nIn the United States, \"alcohol free\" means it has exactly 0% alcohol. \"Non-alcoholic\", on the other hand, only means it has less than 0.5% alcohol by volume.\n\nAlcohol free malts are generally made exactly the same way as a normal malt is made. The difference is that alcohol free products are then put through a distillation process to boil off the alcohol. Alcohol boils at a lower temperature and higher pressure than water and the other compounds that make up the drink, and thus can be separated out first. Typically, to avoid damaging the flavor components, an alcohol free drink will be distilled using a near vacuum rather than temperature. The alcohol is then discarded, or used in another product, while the main drink is bottled and sold as the alcohol free product.\n\nThis process is actually very similar to what is used to make spirits, with the difference being the desired side of the process. In fact, you could sell the \"waste\" alcohol from the distillation process as a spirit. There is also a decent chance it will be processed into hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, or other alcohol products, depending on purity requirements.\n\nThe Heineken¬†0.0 drink is processed through this enough to ensure that *all* alcohol is removed. Per US law, they cannot have any measurable amount left to label it as \"alcohol free\" - there is no legal tolerance at all for any alcohol to remain. This will generally mean they will lose more of the water and other components of the drink than if they only guaranteed it drops below the 0.5% threshold legally required for \"non-alcoholic\". It also means the process will take longer to complete.\n\nTLDR: The basic process is identical for both, and the initial brewing process is the same for a normal alcoholic drink. The difference is in how, and how much, the drink is processed after brewing."}

They probably used a lot of tricks to make it less than that.  How about instead of 16 different types of tyles, each screen only has 4 types of tiles (and those 4 can be different for different screens, so one screen might be sand, rock, water and cave, but another screen might be sand, grave stone, bush, and tree).  Now you only need 2 bits for each tile, so your file size is 5.5kb. \n\nAnd maybe you come up with some other shortcuts... like on a desert screen you make \"sand\" the default tile and now you only have to store the data for the rocks on the top of the screen."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/explainlikeimfive. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5 why are shareholders expected return to investment every time when money isn't infinite and infinite growth isn't possible\n\nLike you can't expect everything to be a success and money isn't infinite. Infinite growth can't exist, especially for all shareholders around the world. And yet they expect full return on their investment whereas companies should focus on their clients who buy their products and employees who want to help the company and be rewarded but yet the bosses only seen to focus on making shareholders happy. There seems to have been a shift in this mindset somehow over the decades.\n\nIt's naive on my part and it's more complicated than what I wrote, but I'm curious and I would like to understand. Thank you for your help!", "assistant": "This is a very, very confused question. Growth and money don't have to be infinite for me to expect a 10% return on my investment from now until the end of time. \n\nFirst off, profit does not require growth. The fact that we think of economic growth as \"normal\" is a product of the fact that we live in a time were growing populations, new technologies, and capital accumulation have led to very, very fast economic growth by historical standards. Obviously, this provides opportunities for profit, and people want to take advantage of them.\n\nBut profit doesn't *require* this. A business that spends $100,000,000 a year and takes in $110,000,000 in revenue is profitable, even if it never grows. A store owner can keep buying goods for $100 and selling them for $200, day in and day out, year after year, without buying a bigger store. A landlord can buy a house and keep charging rent on it as long as people want to live there without the value of the house increasing.\n\nA corporation that makes $10,000,000 in profit this year can use that money to try to expand operations, but sometimes they just mail it out to their shareholders. That's what *dividends* are.\n\nSecond, the overall economy does not need to grow in order for me to expect my personal investments to grow. The reason people invest their money is that, at some point, they want to take their profits and spend them. Very typically, this involves spending 40-50 years working and investing their savings, and then 10-20 years living off of those savings and the profits they earned. At that point, their personal investments will be shrinking, while younger workers will begin saving and will expect their personal investments to grow.\n\nThird, growth does not need to be infinite in order to be sustainable over any particular time period that we actually care about. We have every good reason to think that we can continue to grow over the next 100 years. Technology is still improving and we still have a lot of opportunities to make ourselves more productive by accumulating more capital goods. As long as the world governments can not start WW3, we shouldn't be anywhere near our peak yet. The fact that economic growth might cap out in 2512 isn't going to stop people from expecting economic growth in 2024. \n\nFourth, the idea that companies should \"focus on their clients\" instead of shareholders is fundamentally confused. Companies make money by providing services that their clients are willing to pay money for. A company that isn't doing that isn't going to stay profitable and isn't going to make its shareholders happy. That doesn't mean what clients or employees are going to get 100% of what they want 100% of the time, but that's silly and unreasonable anyway. \n\nWhen companies stop providing value to customers it isn't because they're just too darned concerned about profits and shareholders, it's because their management has become dysfunctional and their judgment about *how* to provide value to customers has become skewed. Or they don't really care about customers or shareholders and are just using the company for their own personal ego-stroking. This generally when shareholders either start selling- tanking the stock- or vote out the board and demand change."}

Store bought is more opaque and tends to just taste different from biting into an orange. Why?", "assistant": "All that \"100% orange juice, not from concentrate\" stuff you've been drinking technically is 100% orange juice but not in the way freshly squeezed at home with a juicer is. It's complicated.\n\nOnce the juice is squeezed and stored in gigantic vats, they start removing oxygen because removing oxygen from the juice allows the liquid to keep for up to a YEAR without spoiling. This is good because people don't start hating orange juice ~~in the fall~~ when it isn't growing season and then suddenly start craving it again when oranges are actually growing on trees. For the sake of year-round juice, we pasteurize, which is great at keeping orange juice shelf stable, but absolutely devastating to flavor. \n\nSo--in order to have OJ actually taste like oranges--the beverage companies hire flavor and fragrance companies to create \"flavor packs\" to make juice taste like orange juice. The flavor packs vary from company to company which is why you probably have a favorite \"brand\" of orange juice when logically one squeezed orange should taste like another, but they all contain ethyl butyrate, which our brains associate with \"this tastes like orange juice probably should.\"\n\nSo how do they get away with saying \"100% juice\"? Those flavor packs are made from oranges and orange byproducts--such as the aforementioned ethyl butyrate--so the FDA doesn't require that they list these as separate ingredients, so if you pick up a bottle of orange juice and the only ingredient is \"oranges,\" that's why.

If humans were to eat just one food like that it seems to me that we would not get enough nutrients to live.  How do animals get all their nutrition?", "assistant": "Very few animals have extremely narrow diets, and animals tend to eat things that we don't. For example, carnivores will eat organs and entrails, while most of the time humans throw these out. Those organs often are packed with nutrients which are almost impossible to find in muscle tissue, which is most of what we think of as \"meat\". Plant eaters usually eat a lot more by volume and often have lots of helpful microbes in their gut to help digest their food. \n\nIt is possible to stay alive on a very limited diet. It's healthier to eat more whole foods and get a broader range of nutrients. Also, eating \"just one food\" is a little misleading. If that one food is whole cooked potatoes, you can probably survive indefinitely. If that one food is white bread, you'll suffer from metabolic issues due to a lack of essential nutrients (white flour is made by removing the most nutritious parts of the grain, so it's missing a lot of good stuff)"}

What I don't quite understand is how it's possible to convert millions of messages, emails, etc every second and transmit them back and forth using only a few of those transoceanic cables. Basically, how do they funnel down all that data into several cables?", "assistant": "In the earliest days of wire-based communication (analogue), there was only one signal on the wire at a time.\n\nLater, we learned to pass multiple signals by using different frequencies/wavelengths for different signals. In it's simplest forms, imagine that instead of shining a white light down a wire for one signal, you're shining red, green, and blue lights. By measuring the amount of red, green, and blue light at the other end, you can separate the signals. That's the principle, just scaled up and with a bit of fiddly detail at each end. This gives us (with current technology) up to about 80 signals per strand of fiber. A cable can have dozens of fibers, so that's potentially a few thousand signals in a cable with a hundred fiber strands\n\nBut as you say, there are millions of data transfers... this part is fairly easy though. Although the signals appear to be fully simultaneous, we don't actually have a constant connection along each possible pathway: what we do is break our data up into chunks called \"packets\", and put an address on it of where it needs to go (your IP address).\n\nThat might sound strange, but think of it like sending things in the mail. Instead of having someone drive back and forth and give the message, we put them in packets, and send them down the road with an address on it.\n\nThink of our cable as a road network. We make a road (a strand of fiber) and then we give it 80 lanes: those are our multiple signals. Now imagine we can overlap those signals so all 80 lanes are just one lane where the cars don't interfere with each other.\n\nAnd then for each lane, we can send lots of individual cars (packets) down one after another, with their own destinations. We don't need to make a full connection (lane) between each pair of destinations, we just send everything down the shared lanes and let it split off when it needs to.\n\nAnd then we combine a whole bunch of these roads (fibers) into one cable. So imagine we have 100 of these roads next to each other."}

And who repairs, manages these cables.", "assistant": "Well the original transoceanic telegraph cables were laid by the telegraph companies. Then later the phone companies. These used good old fashioned copper wires (originally just one or two) in a LOT of shielding, and then later simple repeaters or amplifiers (and the power to drive those). \n\nLater on the cables switched from using copper conductors to fiber optic cables - the nice thing about fibre is you can shove multiple different color wavelengths of light down the same cable, so you can \"multiplex\" hundreds of different signals simultaneously. And with the right electronics to encode/decode and multiplex these light signals _very fast_ you get a single fiber optic strand carrying tens of gigabits per second of data. Now run _multiple_ fiber optic strands in the same cable == lots of bits / second. \n\nWho runs and maintains them? The equipment, ships and personnel to make and lay and splice these cables across the ocean are ridiculously expensive - so there are only a few companies who specialize in doing this. These companies are contracted by the companies who want (and are willing to pay for) the cables. THOSE companies might be telco's or governments or a consortium of telcos willing to \"split\" the cost. Big data companies too - Google is laying cables now. \n\nBut, to over simplify, you want a data cable from New York to Paris (or the closest beaches to)? You go to the cable making co and the switching gear maker and say \"I want x channels over y fibres at z data rate\" and they tell you what equipment they can make and what the cable will look like (how thick, how much can it bend, how frequent the repeaters have to be, what the max length of spool they can make - you can't get a cable to go all the way, they have to make several and splice them together). Then you go to your cable laying company, give deets on the cable and they say yay or nay. Then you go and buy your landing points - literally where the cable comes ashore and connects to ground infrastructure. There's gonna be a shack or a bunker with gear etc. and all the interconnects with your land infrastructure. \n\nThen you fork over gobs of money, all the stuff gets made, the ship rolls up the spools of cable and they start at one side and start laying cable, splicing the segments together.\n\nedit: then, once your cable is connected up how do you make money on it (unless you're going to utilize all of its bandwidth yourself, like Google)? Well, you connect up your cable ends with switches and routers that connect to other lines for various other big telcos and you start charging them for bandwidth - you just saved them the $hassle$ of laying or contracting their own cable to get more bandwidth from A to B - they run a line to your ocean cable terminus, hook up the gear and you charge them by the Terrabyte.

It talked about quantum entanglement and qubits, but I don't understand how it connects with quantum teleportation.\n\nCan anyone explain it to me in a easy way?", "assistant": "First of all, we are nowhere near teleportation of things. When talking about \"quantum teleportation\", we talk about individual particles. One the first sight, this doesn't seem very exciting - why would I want to teleport an electron, if there are plenty of them everywhere? Furthermore, all particles of the same type are indistinguishable by principle, so it really seems a bit pointless...\n\nTo understand why it is such a big deal, you need to learn a little about quantum mechanics. The key piece of information is that every particle, or a system of particles, is in a \"state\" - which you can imagine as a list of its properties - and it is *fundamentally impossible* to learn this state completely. Maybe you heard about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, that you can only know the exact position or the exact velocity, but not both? This is true in general for any \"state\" - by looking at the particles, you can determine some information (of your choice by the choice of your experiment), but never *all* the information.\n\nSo imagine you have some quantum system (one particle, a handful of particles ...) and you want to replicate it elsewhere. How do you do that when you can't measure the entire state of your system? You don't know what you are supposed to replicate! And that's the beauty of quantum teleportation - it is a process that allows you to replicate your system without ever knowing all its properties - the teleportation process makes sure that the state is the same, without telling you what it is. In the process, the original system is typically \"destroyed\" (its state is irreversibly changed), so what's why it's not copying but \"teleportation \". But you haven't \"teleported\" the particles, just their state."}

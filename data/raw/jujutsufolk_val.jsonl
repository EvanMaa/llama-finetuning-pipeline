{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Hot take: Yuta living and getting back to his original body makes more sense than people think\n\nJust hear me out‚Ä¶.\n\nA lot of people have issues with how Yujo/Yuta were handled in the final arc and while it isn‚Äôt perfect, I feel it makes sense for not only his character but how his CT and Rika function. \n\nRika is stated to be an external storage for his CT‚Äôs and we know that CT‚Äôs are stored in the brain and that Rika also functions as a battery of cursed energy for Yuta too, so there is a direct connection between Rika and Yuta‚Äôs brain. We also know that Rika has ‚Äúaccess‚Äù to Yuta‚Äôs senses (specifically, sight) and that‚Äôs how she protects him so well. We have seen Yuta use his 5 minutes before and know that it refills his cursed energy completely. \n\nOnce Yujo passes out, he enters a state of limbo while Fully Manifested Rika still cuddles his body and uses RCT constantly (or Yuta due to the connection) to keep him from dying. The link is there, I don‚Äôt know where the confusion comes from, they have Bluetooth compatibility like they always have, even if we do lack info on how kenjaku‚Äôs CT functions. \n\nAlso while I‚Äôm on the topic, I feel like Yuta becoming a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù and his speech are incredibly valid, in character, and not sudden at all. He deeply cares for his mentor and has constantly been trying to carry his burden with him since he knows the loneliness that comes with great power, although, not to the extent of Sukuna and Gojo perhaps. From Shibuya to Shinjuku, he‚Äôs been a constant ball of stress and putting more and more burdens on himself so that his mentor and classmates don‚Äôt have to make unnecessary sacrifices or get killed (I.e. coming home after Shibuya, protecting Yuji and co., trying to get 400 points by himself, killing Kenjaku ‚Äúalone‚Äù [didn‚Äôt happen but he had convinced himself of that], handling Sendai Colony by himself, etc)\n\nThen to have to plan around your mentor‚Äôs potential death (the person that gave him a reason to live in the first place), only for it to come true and using his body as a weapon in the same way he was used by the higher ups and other sorcerers, knowing how much he hated it?? That‚Äôs pretty fucked up. It‚Äôs not the WORST but that‚Äôs still pretty fucked up, I don‚Äôt understand why people feel that he should‚Äôve died or had more consequences. He literally got cut in half and had his brain put into his teacher, only to ‚Äúpass out‚Äù 5 minutes later and not know whether he‚Äôll wake up or not, is that not consequence enough?? People also say that it felt sudden or out of character, but let me remind you that this is the same kid who made a death binding vow 1 year into jujutsu in order to kill some racist guy who beat up his friends lmao\n\nI‚Äôm not saying the situation was handled perfectly by ANY means but Gege also had a plan going into the final arc and wanted to finish other characters arcs during the final showdown aswell, like Choso, Nobara ü§¢, and Higaruma for example. He also had a few health issues along the way as well, so maybe his vision wasn‚Äôt fully developed as much as he liked but I feel like that‚Äôs a great ‚Äúconclusion‚Äù to Yuta as a character. In that moment, Yuta stepped into the same position as Gojo despite how fucked up he knew it was because he wants to protect the people who give his life meaning, even if that means being a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù or walking over the things that mean the most to him for the betterment of others because that‚Äôs just who Yuta is.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

The culmination of the supposed most important fight of all time in-verse led to... this. A binding vow last second BS for plot continuity (Kenjaku style). \"Well actually the WCS was explained-\" blah blah I don't care. It's trash. Just because something is explained doesn't mean it's good.\n\nI was actually shocked how terrible Gege made Sukuna look in the fight. Everyone says that he glazed the character for some reason even if it's completely the opposite. When he gets hit, he makes SURE that it's expressive. Sukuna relied on Mahoraga completely once the domains were out of the way.\n\nI would understand if Gege made Sukuna use the Ten Shadows over his own technique if he had fleshed it out, but no. He uses rabbit escape once... Agito that got one shotted... that's it. He only uses Mahoraga which bails him out in every critical situation and still manages to look garbage.\n\nSo called the \"natural disaster\" looks anything but a disaster and more like a joke as soon as someone isn't bug level going up against him. Even after the Gojo fight he gets his ass kicked by literally everyone, and then we get that one pathetic panel hyping him up that he isn't going all out. He kills Choso who wasn't even a threat to him with Furnace and... continues getting his ass kicked.\n\nHe of course dies in the end, and Uraume states that they wouldn't have won if Sukuna had his original body... Plot ambiguity! Boy I sure hope that people will discuss this!... Nobody gives a shit. IF IF IF IF IF IF IF. It's excuses after excuses with this manga.\n\nThe military plotline...? What is that?\n\nKenjaku having a satisfying ending...? Fights...? NUH UH! Let me quickly dispose of him with one slash so Sukuna can keep my manga from dying! I can have him get jumped for 250 more chapters so I can cover up with the fact that the manga has no story! Kenjaku passed his will on to Sukuna? I guess he did, LOL. \n\nThe Yujo plotline might as well not have existed. Yuta lives anyway! Yuta even gets to keep his own body! What do you mean I could've had Yuta keep living on in Gojo's body and making him choose between selfishly keep using his teacher's body to prolong his own dreams or killing himself/making someone kill the body with him to make it right? Not in this fairy tale manga!\n\nWhat do you mean I could've written Higuruma dying to make things right and keep his promise to Yuji?\n\nYou have Maki who wasn't even confronted for her mass murder. GO girl!\n\nDon't even get me started with Nobara the 30 minute merchant. Mahito nearly looks like a joke now.\n\nGojo getting a proper burial that could've been at least drawn in a corner of a random panel?

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "\"Sukuna CT isn't mid it's actually great!\" NO THAT SHIT IS ASS\n\nThe moment shrine has to attack anyone with durability SLIGHTLY on the same level as its user, it fumbles IMMEDIATELY!!\n\nCan you imagine having a CT so unbelievably ASS that your lethal domain-amped CLEAVES takes 80 years to kill ONE guy?\n\n\"Oh but gojo is literally gojo, of COURSE he would survive that he's at the top of the verse!\" Yeah and his opponent is at THE top of the verse. Like we don't have to talk about how gojo instantly wins here if the roles are reversed since limitless is broken, but can you imagine how BADLY gojo would be fucked if a sukuna level version of any *other* character had him in this situation?\n\n Mahito would have him looking like Mike wazowski within seconds. Jogo might genuinely turn him into charcoal. Geto (If that bum ever unlocked a domain) would've had him swarmed by a trillion curses or had him uzamaki'd into oblivion. Megumi would've been the same but the curses would just be mahoragas. Hell, you wouldn't even NEED a sukuna level version of mai because yorozu wouldve won if she got into this situation.\n\nHell, it's even implied in the story itself because in the two times we see other characters use shrine, (yuta and yuji), yuta (2nd biggest ce reserves in the series btw) was only able to do paper scratches while yuji had to use a bv for it to only work on reincarnated sorcerers (so for like 6 people total). Honestly the fact that this restrictive ass bv didn't have sukuna evaporated after a single blow makes shrine look even MORE ass.\n\nIf you still can't see what I'm saying, then I'd like you to indulge me with a thought experiment. Close your eyes and think of miwa with the technique limitless+6e. You can see a worse version of teen gojo, who's basically invincible and can easily kill people using blue. Close your eyes and think of miwa with CSM. You can see a sorcerer that relies on others to kill low level cursed spirits, but can easily overwhelm others at her level with hordes of enemies. Close your eyes and think of miwa with yuki's technique. You can see somone who may not be that high ranking as a sorcerer, but is still somomone with the power to literally kill people WAY above her.\n\nNow close your eyes and imagine miwa with shrine. To be honest, if I were you, I wouldn't even WANT to see anything, because what would you even witness? \n\nAll in all, sukunas technique is mid at best. Fuga can't even save it because sukuna himself thought it was so ass that he used his jujutsu sense to bv it into somthing usable. Bro even had to trick jogo into staying still so that he could use the baby version of it on him üíî\n\nAlso wcs can't even count because that is just the ten shadows technique and sukuna being exceptional\n\nEven writing all of this out is pissing me off because I'm realizing that shrine might not even be a top TEN technique. \n\nTldr; the caption is lowkey cap bc shrine isn't ass, but shrine isn't really that great of a technique, just mid. Way better than nothing, but damn. Sukuna is gifted bc of his freaky ass body and his broken sense for jujutsu, not for his CT.

While the rest of the cast have cool abilities and traits they're just physically strong dudes who without their Cursed tools are kind of nothing. Not only do they not have any special trait other than being physically strong and immune to the sure hit of *some* Domains,we also just see see them with like 3-4 Cursed Tools. Toji at least switch from the Inverted Spear of Heaven to the Split Soul Katana to time to time while Maki became a Soul Split Katana Merchant. \"Female Toji\" feels like a slur towards Maki, she even stole his cut. The worst Is that their whole flaw, strenght ,isn't even special. There are buff characters like Hakari, Todo, Ryu, Yuji, Gojo,(Sukuna I can close an Eye),Miguel, Larue etc who have body fit for Sorcery giving them immense physicality. Oh my God I can't fucking stand the \"Yuji has a sort of Heavenly Restricted Body\" statement, why??  Why Is Gojo physically stronger than Toji and Maki? He's just built, I get he's supposed to be \"the honored One\" but in terms of Jujutsu and Cursed Energy, his body has nothing to do with It. Physical strenght Is supposed to be Toji's and Maki's whole flow yet they're not the Strongest physically in their verse. Heavenly Restricted users are just buff guys with cool Curse Tools (Split Soul Katana), they could have had some more interesting traits yet they didn't, it's sad how you can't have fun making \"Full Potential Toji and Maki\" because you can't make anything out of them", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Goatkuna could've beaten Fraudjo even without the 10S\n\n...if killing Gojo was Sukuna's only objective. When Gojo expanded his domain the first time, Sukuna destroyed the barrier from the outside. So, when Gojo expanded his domain for the second time. We see that he reversed the barrier conditions for his domain (Strong on the outside, weak on the inside) in order to counter Sukuna. However, we know that Sukuna can project slashes from the inside of his domain to target the barrier of Gojo's domain from the inside, since it would be weaker from the inside. He did not do this, instead, he continued to break down the barrier from the outside whilst fighting Gojo within, nullifying the Unlimited Void surehit by remaining in constant physical contact with him. He could've destroyed Gojo's barrier from the inside and there would be little Gojo could do, again forcing Gojo on the defensive whilst Gojo healed his CT. This would serve to weaken Gojo, though no doubt he would still be able to cast his domain again. \n\nWhen he eventually casts domain expansion for the third time, when he made it smaller to make the barrier stronger, we know it was still strengthened on the outside rather than on the inside. That's because it lasted 3 minutes against Sukuna's slashes on the outside. Sukuna could have targetted the weaker interior of the barrier and destroyed it, again forcing Gojo on the defensive.\n\nGojo would have to eventually cast domain expansion again for the 4th time against a Sukuna whose domain hasn't been broken a single time. However, no matter how Gojo changes around the conditions of his domain, Sukuna's will win every time. Gojo will be forced to cast domain expansion for the 5th time, but it will fall once again. \n\nAt this point, Gojo will have reached his limit. At this point, Sukuna would eventually defeat him as Gojo is now brain damaged and exhausted.\n\nThis is what Gojo meant when he wondered if he could even beat a Sukuna without the 10S.\n\nBut why didn't Sukuna take this route? It's because he actually has TWO objectives:\n1. Kill Gojo Satoru\n2. Become stronger from learning from Mahoraga how to beat the limitless and presumably other abilities similar to the limitless. The spatial slash that Sukuna learns has durability negation, that's a pretty strong attack. \n\nHad he focused 100% on killing Gojo, he could've done it.\n\nOf course, Gojo could have teleported out of Malevolent Shrine's range, but that would've been pretty damn fradulent. \n\nHad Gojo been able to copy the open domain, it would've been different. Because of course, the donains would've been taken out of the equation, and we all know who wins in a fight of hand to hand combat. Of course, there's no indication that Gojo would've been able to do this. He doesn't have the sheer Jujutsu knowledge that Sukuna has by virtue of age. And if he could do so, he would've done it.", "assistant": "This chapter is being misinterpreted alot.  \nGojo was asking why Sukuna isn't summoning Mahoraga so that Gojo wouldn't be able to break his Domain under 3 minutes, having another shikigami to jump on you would be beneficial to Sukuna as he would break Gojo's Domain before Gojo can damage Sukuna enough to break MS.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xpbicyfn5qb1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbd4cd8975b0ec4358fbcb4d259099b448b6f934\n\n1 as this page suggest, Sukuna probably knows Gojo would just simply one shot Mahoraga.  \nBut more importantly was that it was revealed 2 chapters later that Sukuna's MS was only cancelling UV's sure hit (which is how Megumi's soul help Mahoraga adapt to UV), so summoning Mahoraga inside UV would just paralyze Mahoraga who isn't fully adapted to the Domain yet."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Mahoraga pisses me off\n\nWeird rant, but here it goes.\n\nI don't like Mahoraga. At all. That creature drives me up a wall. everything about it from its ability, its purpose in the story, even its design makes me wish it never existed.\n\nFirst things first, I will mention the one thing I think the story does well with it: its relationship with Megumi. I think it does a good job of acting as a precieved obstacle for Megumi and especially his mentality and it makes the payoff of him choosing to let go of it and not relying on it that much better and makes him shine brighter in the fights he has. As a concept, it doesn't really impose itself unnecessarily in the story in that regard.\n\n\nAnd that's the only positive thing I have to say about it. Everything about it especially in the Gojo fight angers me.\n\nFirstly, I despise the way there's no payoff or satisfying resolution about it. From its summon in Shibuya, you are told that no one has ever tamed this Shikigami before. And from that point on, there's this intrigue and mystery of \"how can you beat Mahoraga using the 10S Technique?\" Which is probably the biggest thing yet to be concretly solved in canon about it. There's build-up of \"there's no way this creature is going to stay untamed until the end of the series, someone has to tame it and use it, right?\" And you wouldn't be wrong, except we never see it.\n\nThe payoff happens off-screen. It's tamed off-screen. You don't even get to see how it's done. At first, I assumed that because we never see such an event that's been built up since the start of the story, then it was probably tamed in a way we've seen before; namely, Sukuna just oneshotting it with Malevolent Shrine like in Shibuya. But I saw someone pointing out that since MS doesn't target Sukuna, Mahoraga wouldn't be targetted either since it's an extension of him powered by his CE. And I've seen people say Sukuna would want to figure out how to tame it using the 10S since he's so interested about other techniques. And to that I say, \"well, why didn't we get to see it?\" \n\nWhy was this never shown? I would've loved to see how Sukuna would tame Mahoraga, and I bet a couple others would've too. I mean, this is the event that's been hyped up since we've seen what that creature looks like. Hell, it would even act as a great mini training scene for us to see how Sukuna did all of that instead of just \"oh! He's in the bath, now he's off to kill Yorozu and between those two events he managed to master the technique and tame the rest of the shikigami! But you don't get to see it! And now there's Agito, a combination of four very useful shikigami but it never uses its powers! And you never get to see what Tiger Funeral is.\" (This is a personal gripe im just salty sbout lol)\n\nI'm just supposed to accept that now he has Mahoraga because \"of course he does, he's the King Of Curses!\"? All this hype and build-up for what?\n\nAnd okay, I know it's a plot device. I don't really mind plot devices because sometimes they're needed to move the story along, even if they're a bit convenient at times. And I know Gege came up with it specifically for the Sukuna VS. Gojo fight so the stakes of the fight are that much higher. But Mahoraga is bad at its job.\n\nIt broke any immersion I had in the fight. I found myself liking the scenes before it showed up better: the domain clashes were cool, Sukuna and Gojo's witty banter and chemistry was enjoyable to read through, and even their H2H exchanges had me hyped for the fight.\n\nBut after it showed up, the fight felt less enjoyable for me. I don't know how to explain it, but it feels so out of place in the fight. Like it's shoe-horned in. It's clearly a plot device but it's so awkward about it. Its attacks towards Gojo feel like they were written in AFTER the fight was over and Gege needed a way to incorporate it into the story, if that makes sense. It just doesn't interact with the rest of the fight well enough for me to feel it's natural. The only moments I liked from that point on where whenever Gojo and Sukuna fought one-on-one, and that's about it. I couldn't even really care about the outcome of Gojo dying because Mahoraga's presence ruined any build-up or stakes in the fight for me.\n\nAnd the worst part is, it doesn't even finish its adaptation. It was still weak and suseptible to destruction from Red or Purple despite all the blows traded. All this, and its only purpose was for Sukuna to use it as a \"model\". It was never the 10th Shikigami in the 10S technique, it was a plot device thrown in the last second to make the outcome believable.\n\nAnd then it gets off-screened, and we never see it again. It never gets brought up, we never know what happens to it now since it's still part of the technique and its power could be passed on, but we never get any info on whether it'll be used again or if that's it, it's served its purpose and now it doesn't matter anymore.\n\nI don't know if it'll ever matter in the story anymore, or whether we'll get an answer on how Sukuna tamed it via a flashback or something, but it seems as of now that's all we'll see from it.\n\nAnother thing that pisses me off is its place in the technique. I feel like a broken record, but it's so obvious Gege came up with Mahoraga waaayyy after the rest of the shikigami, because it really doesn't belong in the technique in general. It doesn't feel balanced to me. Those 6 shikigamis we saw first interacted with the technique and each other just fine; every shikigami brought a power to the table with an animal to match it, complimenting each other pretty well. Hell, even Piercing Ox and Rounding Deer matched the Technique's overall power level, and are based off of animals too, but Mahoraga feels so out of place. It clearly outscales them in power, and it's humanoid-shaped (i'll touch up on this later). It makes the technique so unbalanced and so...unnecessary. It makes the 9 shikigami look like add-ons, which I feel discredits the rest of it heavily. Mahoraga seems like a technique of its own, yet it imposes itself in 10S like it's trying to push in a lego piece that doesn't fit. IMO, i liked the other 9 shikigami better. They worked in tandem and had versatility along with an abundance of strategies, and i feel they alone work very well as an independent Technique. Mahoraga just doesn't belong there. It's an unwelcome house guest. \n\nI think it's also Gojo's comment about it to Megumi that annoys me. When Gojo was trying to insinuate that Megumi could be as strong as him, and brought up the old Clan Heads that fought, it was implying that the only way for Megumi to reach that level is if he were to tame Mahoraga. I don't know if that was what Gojo's intention was, but that's certainly the message it sent. It made it seem like the rest of the technique wasn't that great and was barely scraping good without Mahoraga in it, which again I feel discredits the rest of it.\n\nIts power also pisses me off. I can't explain how, but to give a Shikigami the power to adapt to anything and everything is such a cheap idea to counter Infinity IMO. And I guess Gege also realized that because he had to nerf Mahoraga heavily by making its base not that durable and take such a long time to adapt to any move otherwise it'd be complete overkill.\n\nLastly, its design. This is just a personal gripe, but holy fucking hell do I absolutely abhor how it looks. I know it's based off of The Twelve Heavenly Generals, which is what the entire Technique is based off of, but the design does not fit a Shikigami, at ALL. Its face is so stupid. It doesn't even fit the usual animal-like designs of the rest. And I get it's because it's the \"General\" and its leader along with the adaptation power which is a trait humans have so it looks the closest to what a human is, but i still don't like it. It seperates it even further from the rest of the technique and not in a \"it's different from the rest because of its prestige and importance\" way but in a \"it doesn't even belong here\" type of way.\n\nAlso, why is it wearing pants? This is the first Shikigami we see even have two legs much less pants (the second is Agito) and it's so weird. It's a whole ass Shikigami, why does it need pants? Is this implying it has genetalia? If yes, what the fuck. If no, then why?? Could've at least made the lower half a tail or something or make it be like Rika. Or hell, just. Don't add pants if you want it to have legs that badly. I know it's a stupid detail, but i'm always so perplexed by it.\n\nThe long and short of it is that it's a terrible plot device because not only does it barely do its job, it ruins everything else around it in the process and i can't stand it. That's all i have to say about it until i remember something else that pisses me off about it", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "For the people who wants to drop the manga now...\n\nDrop it now because nothing will ever satisfy you. Gojo had a proper sendoff and the only bad thing in the chapter was the offscreen. I'm quite convinced no one actually wants to see other characters other than Gojo. \n\nIt's actually insane how many Gojo fans missed the point of his death and cry about how \"useless\" his death was, saying things like his unsealing was \"pointless\" for some reason. I don't think Gojo died for nothing. The screenoff was most likely something Gege wanted to hide for now so that it would be convenient for later. He kept it open so that future fights would be easier to write. Gojo replenishing with his black flashes and a critical conditioned Sukuna has an obvious gap, so for the switchup to happen there should be a fight right? People think Sukuna just one shotted Gojo when it was clear Gege just didn't include it for now.\n\nThere is still Yuji, Yuta, Kashimo and Megumi and people suddenly forgot the hype of these characters because they were focused on Gojo only. I guess JJK really is just popular because of Gojo which is really sad. \n\nA lot of people aren't taking their time in analyzing the chapter and how it applies for the future and recurring themes in the manga. \n\nFor example a lot of people seem to think Cleave became broken because it apparently \"slashes reality and space\" and how it's an asspull how Sukuna learned about it, when it has been hinted chapters ago that Sukuna is known to improvise and mimic techniques. And how Sukuna is \"getting bodied\" when the point of his strategy was letting Gojo attack and letting Mahoraga adapt, and how it doesn't make sense that he was nervous and then the next chapter he one shots Gojo, and how he didn't even need TS.\n\nHe needed TS because it was his most efficient way in coming up with a Cleave that can bypass infinity. He needed TS because he had more fights after Gojo. He didn't come to the fight thinking Gojo is the only problem he has to face. That's why he was \"holding back\". He was nervous because his plan contains a lot of risk and he was facing GOJO out of all people.\n\nAnd people didn't seem to like how he complimented Sukuna. So are we just forgetting that he was so alone for being too strong it made him depressed? Isn't part of him being a teacher was so that his students become as strong as him so he won't be alone anymore? So it's out of character for him to admire someone who he lost to because he lived for years being alone at the top?\n\nIf you want to drop the manga then drop it right now. There is still a lot of interesting things apart from Gojo vs Sukuna, personally I'm waiting for Yuta's promise to Gojo and Yuji's duality with Mahito and how he would settle the score with Sukuna.

Queue the reverse flash posts ik, but the overall consensus seems to be a lot of distain towards him and it is a little disheartening I can‚Äôt lie. I just wanna talk about each point of which people use to dog on Megumi and just explain how it‚Äôs either a misunderstanding or a writing flaw.\n\nSummoning Mahoraga against Haruta:\nHonestly this one kinda shocks me, Megumi was just about to die and he thought ‚Äúman this dude is annoying, how about I use my strongest move on him because I‚Äôm dying anyways lol.‚Äù Which to me makes perfect sense, he had no way of knowing Sukuna would actually show up and cause all of THAT to happen. For all he knew, Mahoraga would kill Haruta and then vanish instantly, leaving both dead. \n\nGetting hurt by a flower pot in Reggie fight (yes, seriously people are hung up on this):\nBad writing ngl, Megumi was thrown through BUILDINGS by Sukuna yet a flower pot does real damage to him? That‚Äôs just weird. \n\nMegumi not taming many of the 10S:\nBad writing, Greg just rushed the manga for no reason. Only recent tame was max elephant and that was off screen, no idea why Gege would do that. \n\nGetting beat up by a grade 2:\nI honestly have no idea how this even happened, genuinely no reason this should‚Äôve happened idk why Gege didn‚Äôt just bump the cursed spirit up to grade 1 or something.\n\nTodo beating him up:\nToji beat up a fuck ton of cursed spirits without his ct, he is just THAT strong.\n\nExcessive Mahoraga usage:\nSo let‚Äôs go over the times he tried to summon Mahoraga. Sukuna, special grade, last resort on death bed and Sukuna again. Kinda reasonable ngl? Also, idk where the idea of him trying to summon Mahoraga against Todo because I never saw him do the hand sign or the chant? \n\nToji beating him up:\nIt‚Äôs..Toji‚Ä¶..? He annihilated a special grade and beat Gojo and Geto alone? Why would he NOT beat Megumi? And Megumi still did well, at least in some respect. \n\nMegumi giving up:\nHonestly? Bad writing, I can see why people hate him for this. I don‚Äôt understand why Gege would make Megumi literally give up when characters (some being his friends) around him are dying trying to get him out, that panel absolutely killed all reason to save him and it‚Äôs so bad. \n\nThat‚Äôs all I can think of rn, if anyone has any other point then comment it bc I‚Äôd love to talk about it! I‚Äôm not a glazer, not an agenda poster I just care about the manga and this character and it sucks that people misrepresent him so much.

This is backed up by the recent chapter of Yuta asking Angel to do the final blow in a flashback and Hana asking Yuji during the fight if Gojo forgot (he didn‚Äôt) about megumi because of how badly he was hitting Sukuna and trash talking him, because the plan wasn‚Äôt for Gojo to kill him. This is why the 200% purple was 4km away instead of Gojo binding vow teleporting right behind Sukuna and Instant Kamehamehaing his ass, why Gojo said he would ‚Äúbring you (Sukuna) closer to death‚Äù by destroying some organs that we‚Äôre almost certain Sukuna can live without in his inner monologue instead of charging up a purple after his domain hit.

If he was charging a purple intended to kill Sukuna and then Mahoraga showed up, he could‚Äôve at the very least killed Mahoraga then and there with the Purple he charged, meaning Sukuna wouldn‚Äôt be able to learn WCS. But he wasn‚Äôt charging a Purple because he wasn‚Äôt trying to kill Sukuna because of Megumi. This is also why the exploding nuke Purple didn‚Äôt kill Sukuna, because it wasn‚Äôt intended to. Think about it, Gojo didn‚Äôt know that he would take less damage from the Purple than Sukuna would due to it being his own cursed energy. This means that if you think it was intended to kill Sukuna there then Gojo would‚Äôve been fine with killing himself there too since he was closer to it, but if that were true then he would‚Äôve made a binding vow in exchange for his life for the Purple to be stronger if he already thought it might kill him, he would make sure it at least killed Sukuna as well. But he didn‚Äôt do any of that because it wasn‚Äôt mean to kill sukuna, just Mahoraga. ‚Äúbut then why did Gojo glaze Sukuna in the afterlife?‚Äù \n1. Gojo didnt even glaze that much, he just acknowledged the strongest opponent he faced.\n2. You need to understand that Gojo has no idea what killed him, Gojo did NOT hear Sukuna‚Äôs explanation because he was too busy in the airport. So from Gojo‚Äôs perspective it went from ‚ÄúI‚Äôve basically won‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve died instantly‚Äù with no idea of what‚Äôs happened. This leads to Gojo simply thinking that Sukuna could‚Äôve just done that whenever (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me he could‚Äôve ended the fight here!?! With Strong Cleave?!?‚Äù) and that beforehand he wasn‚Äôt going all out until he was cornered. That is why Gojo says what he does in the airport. Let me know if there‚Äôs anything that needs clearing up, I‚Äôm not used to writing bigger posts like this so It might be a bit sloppy.\n\nTLDR: Gojo beats Sukuna if he wasn‚Äôt trying to save Megumi which we know he was. Goatjo remains the strongest in the verse.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

On one side including translators etc say hollow purple is made of virtual mass. Another side including mathematicians, and gege suggest hollow purple is imaginary mass / have imaginary numbers.\n\nThe sources are not fan made, and are accepted by this statements:\n\n\"T: So we explained it up to this point. Also, since we have the opportunity, I will show it to the editor-in-charge Katayama-san. Katayama-paisen, what do you think?\n\nKatayama (K): These are the most difficult sentences I‚Äôve read in my life as an editor‚Ä¶ But somehow there‚Äôs uncanniness‚Ä¶.\n\nT: Above all, I‚Äôm glad you say so. Please share this article to Akutami-sensei, too!\n\nK: He was happy with the extra in vol. 14 and 15, so I think he will be happy with this article too.\n\nT: I also want Akutami-sensei‚Äôs first editor Yamanaka-san to read this too.\n\nK: You really like Yamanaka, huh (laugh)\n\nThis last part is recommendation for two reference books you can read to further understand this topic. First time I see texbooks advertised in Jump lol)\n\n‚Ä¶\n\nA bit about the people involved here:\n\nTakano is the same Takano (T-san) in the extra comic from vol. 14 and 15 (Lets settle this! Limitless cursed technique). Katayama is Akutami-sensei‚Äôs current editor, while Yamanaka is his first editor. From what he had said, Akutami-sensei seems to have a bit of beef with Yamanaka-san lol\"\n\n\\-part 4\n\nSo this scaling starts with blue and red.\n\nBlue is a force of attraction, helped by Gojo bringing in negative distance/space into reality.\n\nRed is a force of repulsion because of the two blues multiplied together to get a positive force, which is why red is twice the output of blue.\n\nAccording to their conclusion:\n\n\"Using the Limitless cursed technique ‚ÄúRed‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù, Gojo can do conversion and change the scale of distance between him and his opponent.  \"\n\nNow the \"distance between him and the opponent\" refers to gojos cursed technique of neutral limitless, i.e infinity. Now miguel clearly states that Gojos infinity works on the atomic level. To affect Gojos infinity by manipulating the distance, blue and red must be on the atomic level because if not, the distance wouldn‚Äôt be different. Therefore we can deduce that red and blue are both atomic level ct.\n\nLet the glaze begin here.\n\nAccording to Sanoda Takano and hino,\n\nTakano (T): So we have defined ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed‚Äù and now we have to think about ‚ÄúPurple‚Äù. (Akutami-sensei) said it is a mix of the two but‚Ä¶.\n\nSonoda (S): Before you said (he) wanted to use imaginary numbers, but isn‚Äôt this actually Minkowski metric? Minkowski metric is the result of breaking inner product axiom, but it tolerates minus results from squaring. It resembles imaginary numbers. To explain it simply, it will appear like negative length, and looks like it is hollowed. In opposite, the problem is when you define this, you will wonder if you can define ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed‚Äù\n\nHino (H) : I also don‚Äôt know if it can be properly investigated. Since Minkowski also have moving domain in the usual Euclidean target, if we cover it, it will look like that. In simple terms, if we think only in plus axis, it maybe can come to ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù or ‚ÄúRed‚Äù, but if we think to the direction of imaginary numbers, it looks like it will become ‚ÄúPurple‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if it will be equivalent of mixing the two, though.\n\nT: I see. Let‚Äôs establish the assumption for Minkowski metric we talked earlier, it needs closer scrutiny. I will summarize it a bit, So Gojo is a technique user who can tamper with the scale of local distance after all. Actually the space that Gojo deals with looks like it can tolerate special inner product.\n\nH: With that you can define imaginary numbers-like concept using Minkowski metric.\n\nT: However, there is no way we can properly investigate whether that assumption can accept ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù or ‚ÄúRed‚Äù. Let‚Äôs just expect it from enthusiastic fans.\n\nH: Anyway, it‚Äôs thanks to those extra pages of Jujutsu Kaisen that I see people who considers the math in quite varying places when they are looked up.\n\nT: Really‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a work that gathers a lot enthusiasm.\n\nS: For now, let‚Äôs wrap it at this point, I think people with mathematics knowledge of 3rd year university students can understand it, while the mathematicians can turn to their textbooks. \"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski\\_space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space)  \nThey refer to hollow purple as \"imaginary number\" like gege said but also to the \"minkowski metric\", which refers TO A 4D SPACE. Wow the glaze innit. Yeah well, it was able to erase tojis 4d worm from existence, leaving only Toji with an apple logo.\n\nLook all of this seems like something that was cooked but became burnt.\n\nLets look at some counters:\n\n\"Hollow purple is not existence erasure! Therefore buildings in jjk have existence erasure resistance\"\n\nRight so imaginary mass doesnt mean erasure but since the mathematicians say that \"hollow purple appear like negative length and hollow \". Sure.\n\nHollow purple is not or shoulnt be considered as fully existence erasure. It's mainly a form of a spatial attack that violently displace matter. So if hollow purple is sent out like a normal spherical ball, it can disintegrate or erase objects like mahoraga, and his wheel( very improtant because fuga didnt do that),agito, a building or two in his shinjuku unlimited purple, agito, and tojis ISOH with worm. They were all performed at a close range, effectively making hollow purple one shot to anyone.\n\n\"But what about Sukuna? He resisted it. 2 times in fact. Hanami? Urame\"\n\nWell the first time hollow purple is 4km away from sukuna which decreased output, and although was a direct hit, sukuna used domain Amplification with cursed energy reinforcement despite having a cursed energy bath literally before the battle, which made Sukuna much stronger.\n\nAlso with due respect, jacobs ladder is stated to be existence erasure but a weakened sukuna was able to tank 3 of them and climb up the 4th one to hit the angel unhindered. If an existence erasure technique showed little effect on a weakened sukuna, the megkuna hit by unlimited purple, clearly exhausted, limping and on 1hp caused by the damage, showcases a level of power unlimited purple or purple can pose.\n\nUramae was behind sukuna and sukuna took the brunt of the attack with his hands.\n\nRecall the dialogue: HP behaves like a \"negative/imaginary\" space interval.  \n\\-Direct hit (full immersion): Space becomes undefined (total erasure).  Peripheral hit (glancing blow): Space is warped but not nullified (matter is shredded, not erased).\n\nThis is why:  \nPeople/objects at the epicenter -trees that were erased and not seen when targeting hanami (she dodged ti and is a cursed spirit)  \nBuildings at the edge are sliced/torn apart, leaving rubble\n\nWhy you may ask? Why this have an effect on hollow purple erasure?\n\nFirrstly its best to say spatial erasure with a little bit of existence erasure due to the reality warping of blue and red. Secondly the \"void\" becomes weaker until the range dissipates and explodes as a blast towards the end, leaving debris. For example, when unlimited purple was fired, there was a couple of areas that were smooth while others layered with debris. This shows that hp can act as a form of EE but not a very big range, only effective in close range.\n\nAn apology for this would be standing in a black holes horizon at the epicenter which guarantees no survival (like kenjaku and yuki)\n\nBut being further away from the \"void like\" black hole would make the attraction and pushing weaker.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

He outplayed Gojo in almost every domain battle and Gojos only saving grace was superior h2h combat, which he wouldn't have against a Heian Era Sukuna. He's literally on the ground in chapter 230 about to LOSE. If Sukuna didn't take brain damage, Gojo literally gets mid diffed there.\n\nNow for the second half of the fight, Gojo 100% percent has the advantage. Only difference is Sukuna doesnt have the saving grace he can fall back on so it looks worse on his end. And its easier to see/comprehend physical dominance or even value it more then intellect/jujutsu or magic stuff.\n\nActually the fight officially begins in 224 and Id say the turning point is 230 which is 6 chapters Sukuna has the advantage. Then from 230 to 236 Gojo has the advantage. 6 chapters for Sukuna and 6 for Gojo which I think Gege did on purpose.\n\nTDLR: Sukuna dominated to the first half, Gojo dominated the second half of their fight but people see it as Gojo dominating the whole fight because its easier to put value on physical dominance compared to brains or magic stuff.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Jujutsu Kaisen tier list up to 238\n\nNow there are problems with this list, lots of people are down there because I simply dont know anything about them or cant guage them\n\nLike Teen Geto, he got no diffed by Toji without ever showcasing his power on someone important, or Uraume, we havent seen their power either, Dhruv got offscreened after having 1 panel or something, Miguel is weirdly strong for whatever reason but thats all I know about him, Juzo got 1 shot by Gojo, idfk anything about Hakaris fuckboy, Charles got beat up by Hakari and thats all I know about him, I refuse to scale the homeless bum, dunno about Angel either, I mean shes shown that she could wipe out Sukuna so theres that.\n\n\nMahoraga can one shot anyone, straightforward, but idk if I should even include it, if I did then I guess above 3F Sukuna should be alright. But getting to 3F Sukuna and why hes at the very top, he still keeps his vast knowledge about Jujutsu, Skills and refinement as well as efficiency, Shrine and every other techniques, his physical stats are scaled by Toji which is insane despite him being at such a low finger amount, he also made quick work of a special grade curse, his Shrine would be weaker on the cleaves but still insanely strong to the point itd still beat out every other Domains imo, Sukunas physical stats are Toji level and his skills and techniques are still present but a little limited due to his low CE. But it really shouldn't be a giant problem imo, theres that thing about Jogo being up to 9F Sukuna of power but I think thats only referring to his CE amount? Im probably wrong but even then, Sukunas massive advantage over physical stats, techniques, skills and refinement should let him beat out Jogo and most other characters even if he isnt directly stronger than them. \n\nAs for pre RCT Gojo and why hes next to As 3F Sukuna, yall might call me stupid but hear me out, yes, Toji was able to humiliate Gojo in the first round, but I mainly chalk that up to Gojo being too worn down to really even perceive Toji well, he had constantly been using Infinity up to that point nonstop to the point he didnt notice Toji until hed gotten stabbed, Kid Gojo not only noticed 2 sorcerers  right away who were in places not able to be seen but also even noticed Toji, im sure I dont need to explain the difference between a toddler and a teen. As for his physical stats, im actually gonna rate it ABOVE Toji, yall might call me stupid, again...but hear me out for the 2nd time, when Gojo healed himself back to full health and was refreshed, he was able to outmatch Toji, dodging everyone his attacks, speed wise he might be slower but who knows, Teen Gojo pre RCT would still have insane CE efficiency, perception, power, CE reinforcement and skill as well as the strongest CT, he was also likely trained since birth using whatever Gojo clan guides and shit for the sex eyes users. As for the inevitable domain expansions, he has simple domain for it, simple!\n\nYorozu is weird to scale but she was doing something against 15F Sukuna so theres that, you can really place her at the bottom since I don't exactly know where to confidently place her, dont think I need to explain the rest at high special grade. \n\nYukis at the top of special grade but she could wipe out some of the high special grade sorcerers, im sure she doesnt need an explanation, Getos below her cause hed get absolutely fucking obliterated by her, Toji and Maki could definitely beat out Geto due to their overwhelming physical stats but I believe Geto at that point is physically capable enough to stall them long enough to cast Uzumaki, you may think otherwise, and if you do, then you can put them above Geto, either way its fine with me, Hakari could be classified as special grade but hed fall behind Geto, Toji and Maki since he doesnt have lethal moves like them, but as for Ryu and Uros placement, its a bit tricky, I can't confidently place them anywhere but I think their placement makes sense? Hakari should be able to contest them with his theoretical infinite domain expansions, Itadori could definitely skyrocket past everyone in special grade but we only have the Sukuna fight to off of for now, Cursya has shown the ability to beat up 1st awakening Maki and also has a domain so imma put him at bottom of special grade, plz dont question Yaga hes stated to be  technically special grade even tho hes shown nothing but the possibility to overthrow a country with his plushies.\n\nJogo is above Mahito because his \"fire\"power, speed and experience is better than Mahitos, Mahito can be placed above Jogo but eh, im their domains should be equal, if not then Jogo should have more refinement since he had it longer plus he should have higher CE and output, thus beating Mahitos out, if not then his maximum technique should be enough, I believe Mechamru can actually beat out Hanami and Dagon due to his insane power in the giant suit and because he could also counter a domain expansion with a simple domain, Megumi is above Choso because he has a domain, thats the only reason, Choso already has shown the capability to beat Naoya, Naoya is just superior to Todo h2h and is much faster, Clap would be less useful in a 1v1 but still pretty useful, still only so much it could do in a 1v1, Ogi is directly stated above Naobito, and from down there everything was irrelevant to me, if you think the scaling below it is weird then im not gonna argue, i didnt put too much thought into it.", "assistant": "Wtf is this list"}

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Yuta does not have to lose and Sukuna can be right.\n\nYuta does not have to lose this fight, in fact he should win (with help of Yuji and Todo) and save Megumi. It doesn‚Äôt matter if he or Yuji gets the final blow, but Yuta shouldn‚Äôt lose for the sake of Sukuna‚Äôs ideals being wrong. In fact Sukuna and his ideals can be right and the story can still make sense. \n\nYuta‚Äôs whole idea is that he has to become the monster to defeat Sukuna, but the main difference is he is doing it out of his love for everyone else while Sukuna has become a monster for himself alone, but both became the monster nonetheless. People claim that Yuji on the other hand has to defeat Sukuna proving his ideals wrong, and that you can become strong without forsaking your humanity, and having another classic MC defeating the big villain. But Yuta winning and proving Sukuna right isn‚Äôt a bad thing and can set up Yuji doing something even more impactful which is to dismantle the Jujutsu society that has allowed these circumstances to even occur. \n\nBecoming a monster and throwing away humanity to be at the top isn‚Äôt just something that is shown in Sukuna and Yuta, but also shown in other facets of Jujutsu society. The higher ups are super corrupt and are at the top. The Zenin clan being a family that treats certain members inhumanly, they are one of the big three families. Kenjaku stealing bodies and conducting terrible experiments and he stays alive for a 1000 years. Tengen absorbs young women, basically killing them, to maintain her form and be more human (kind of ironic). And there are other examples as well. \n\nIn fact we have seen that those who are the most human and kind and empathetic suffer and die. Examples being Haibara, Nanami, Nobara, Mechamaru, while Higuruma and Choso both died trying to regain their humanity. And through this Yuji has seen it all. Ever since he has became a Jujutsu sorcerer he has suffered so much, it is not like what he thought it was. He will see Yuta in Gojo‚Äôs body, see them probably die after the fight is over, and once again be reminded of how terrible Jujutsu society actually is.\n\nI think after seeing and experiencing all this Yuji will want to completely dismantle Jujutsu society and he will do so with Megumi (as he has also suffered greatly) as they activate the merger. I‚Äôm not sure how it will play out, but the Merger could be the key to eliminating cursed energy all together thus dismantling the Jujutsu society. Also Kenjaku said ‚Äúmy will, will be inherited‚Äù, why not have it be his (or her?) son that inherits that will. How fitting would it be if the series ends with Yuji and Megumi completing the revolution against Jujutsu society, but not in the way Geto wanted which is what broke him and Gojo‚Äôs relationship apart. \n\nI understand that everyone wants Yuji to defeat Sukuna as he caused Yuji so much suffering and pain, but I think Yuji‚Äôs purpose will be far greater than just defeating him. It will be to dismantle the society that has perpetuated the suffering of jujutsu sorcerers.", "assistant": "Read the rules. The new chapter leaks must be flaired the orange \"new chapter spoilers\".

Tengen mentions that previously domains enforced rules rather than a lethal sure-hit. However, Higuruma is the only character to use this domain style (Hakari‚Äôs is still a sure-hit style as it doesn‚Äôt apply to himself, he just intentionally relinquished the lethal aspect). Even the ancient characters such as Yorozu, Kenjaku, and Sukuna have lethal sure-hit domains.\n\nI therefore believe Sukuna pioneered lethal sure-hit domains as:\n\n1. He wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the additional expense of this style of domain due to his reserves and efficiency.\n2. Counter domain techniques are implied to not be effective/worthwhile against the old domain style - Sukuna chooses not to use Hollow Wicker Basket in Higuruma‚Äôs domain. Despite this, the simple domain school started during the Heian era. Additionally, I believe counter domain techniques may not be effective against old style domains as the rules apply to the user of the domain, which may strengthen their application.\n3. Tengen is a few hundred years older than both Kenjaku and Sukuna (1200 years old vs 1000) so they would have seen years of old style domains and explains why Kenjaku didn‚Äôt reincarnate any sorcerors with old style domains as Kenjaku and Sukuna are the same age so Kenjaku existed during the era when domains were changing and probably didn‚Äôt have the Culling Games plan in mind at this point.\n\nI hope this is interesting to some people!

Just because he admitted that he MIGHT have lost even without Sukuna 10S basically undermines his character? \n\nNah, the thing is basically Gojo was always called as strongest, and honoured one by himself alone, he is a Sensei he belongs to one of the three strongest clans, and of course feared by even the higher ups because Bro just is possessed by HAX. If he admitted in front of his students that he will not win against Sukuna, then they would have definitely felt under confident, they would have definitely lost their motivation, Yuji would have felt very guilty about reincarnating Sukuna and probably would have tried to execute himself in order to save humanity. \n\nTry to understand the build up of the story, this is not Gojotsu Kaisatoru, he was never meant to take over the place a main character was made for, every single one in the cast will surpass the limits of their own including Yuji, Yuta, Hakari etc... Kashimo CT will really end up being busted never underestimate Gege man, honestly the plot without Gojo is not that bad... Culling Games arc is one of the most underrated arc's in Jujutsu Kaisen. \n\nGojo's character was completed the moment he killed Geto and that's a fact there is no more development he needs or¬† any second awakening, after that he was just a hindrance for the plot to move forward and the characters to develop themselves. \n\nRyomen Sukuna, we know nothing about this character which is supposedly share the throne of being the main antagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen along Kenjaku. They are saying Gojo getting killed for the story in such a way is an asspull? No. Basically whatever happened to Gojo can easily be explained by this post (https://reddit.com/r/Jujutsufolk/s/dO8DoDo1VN), Sukuna's knowledge and analysing of Cursed techniques and true Jujutsu WAS ALWAYS TERMED AS SUPERIOR TO ANYONE, and that's exactly what made him win this battle at the last moment. \n\nSukuna's nervousness against Gojo was not because that he would lose the battle it was because of his hesitation for going all out right now and reveal all his trump cards, if he does that and kill Gojo he would have NOT be able to face his students because they would have already been ready with the strategies that alone explains why he chose 10S to face Gojo, and Gojo knew this already when he pointed out saying \"Why is Sukuna relying on the 10S and the techniques restricted to his own Domain\". \n\nRemember, we don't have any idea of Sukuna's CT still, there is just alot of we don't know about Sukuna and ig when the author will reveal it these arguments will shut down for once and for all. \n\nGojo Satoru's statement of him WINNING against Kenjaku and Sukuna, was not infact clearly termed as him winning and coming out alive against them, it's about his ideologies, his teachings, his guidance dominating and winning against than those of Kenjaku and Sukuna. So either way, GOJO WILL WIN. \n\nGojo's character was not wasted.\nAnd about ABD? \n\nThis same guy used to term Sukuna as a God complex, Bro was like he achieved enlightenment/nirvana, his cursed techniques were so busted, he ruled the entire era etc etc. \n\nBro's making a poll saying \"Was Gojo's character assassinated?\" knowing that majority of the Fandom consists of Gojo fans so the result will be obviously biased lmfao.", "assistant": "Yeah im not reading all that but culling games was mid.

Starting with Gojo, people like to say that six eyes does all the work, but that's really unfair . Sure, six eyes REALLY helps with CE management and perception, but it doesn't grant full mastery of limitless (but six eyes pretty much makes it possible); it's still a very hard technique to get the hang of, even with six eyes. Gojo getting as far as he did with his abilities just goes to show how good a sorcerer he is, and that he's possibly the best six eyes + limitless user to ever be born.\n\nBut with Sukuna, shrine isn't really that OP of a technique, as Sukuna himself said. It all depends on the Cursed output of the user, it's only with Sukuna's sheer mastery of jujutsu sorcery and his amazing cursed energy control does he make shrine one of the best CT's in the show.\n\nSo while who the strongest of the two might forever be a mystery, it's clear that Sukuna is a much more impressive sorcerer than Gojo.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

The difference is that, that curse was from Yuta's power, the hurt caused by it was Yuta's fault by he managed to pull through and control it, while also getting a reason to live again. While Yuji had his curse forced upon him, the hurt it causes not out of his own free will but of Sukuna's.\n\nIt's also just a scene that kick start Yuta's and Yuji's friendship, Yuta cared for Yuji simply because his friends cared for Yuji and that's all he needed to know to agree to save him. Which I just realize is the same thing that happened with Megumi later on. Yyta could have simply killed Sukuna and therfore killed Megumi but instead he chose to stop JL because Megumi was important to others like Yuji, Nobara, and Hana.\n\nIt's also just a nice scene as it also shows how much trust Gojo has for Yuta. Gojo's essentially asking him to be the next Gojo(the irony) by being the one to protect the 1st and 2nd years from the higher ups and to also disobey them.\n\nIt's a overall great scene that introduces Yuta really well, and let's people who haven't read JJK0 to better understand him.\n\n10/10 scene in my opinion.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

However, outside of these two, everyone else gets cooked by Yoriichi.\nToji has only been shown to be a building level character and can go speeds up to Mach 3. On the other hand, Yoriichi scales way higher than a base Mitsuri. This same Mitsuri can dodge lightning calculated to be massively hypersonic. This is way above Mach 3, meaning Yoriichi could just blitz Toji and be done with it. Not only that, but you can argue that he‚Äôs city level due to Douma‚Äôs scaling. Also, it‚Äôs stated that the Demon Slayer Mark is a 100 times multiplier, making Yoriichi‚Äôs speed even crazier.

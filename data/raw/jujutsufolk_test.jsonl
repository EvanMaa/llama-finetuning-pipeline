There was no big threat, just the characters interacting with each other and living after the fight.\n\n- Yuji was characterized well. Him understanding the Curse User's situation and telling him he expects great things from him, is both in character for someone like Yuji, and shows the effects Gojo had on him.\n\n- We finally saw a bit more of Gojo. Him not being only confident in himself, but rather believing in his students, the same way he did when he was sealed away. He knew that everything will be fine even if he is gone, fulfilling his goal of raising powerful and competent allies he can rely on.\n\n- Mahito still being miserable. Him being from the hatered of humanity towards itself makes sense that he can't change and will always strike for chaos and destruction.\n\n- Sukuna admitting he lost and him admitting he could have chosen a different path but gave into his own curse and now willing to make a different choice if there is a chance.\n\n- Yuji ended the cycle of curses. While Sukuna lives the cycle of curses will continue. Yuji ended it by killing Sukuna, but also by being the sweet forgiving guy who he is giving others a second chance.\n\n\nOver all, yeah, it is by far from a perfect or even a good ending.

Here's the thing though, Gege paced the manga with the idea of deliberately off screening that fight, and, accordingly, I think it's a little difficult to figure out how the anime staff would actually show it without gutting the pacing of Shinjuku Showdown. I mean, some people already think the arc is poorly paced, though, I tend to disagree. I think complaints about the mangas pacing were primarily due to it being published week to week. The arc is like 90 percent fighting, so, truthfully, it should fly by in the anime. My issue is that I just don't know where you slot in the fight? What moments of the Sukuna fight do you interrupt? Where are the natural break points where you could feasibly cut back to Hakari and Uraume without boring the audience or making them feel like you're dragging things out?

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Naoya Zen’in was a better-written villain than Sukuna and Kenjaku.\n\nNow that the dust has settled and we can look at JJK in its entirety from beginning to end, let me just say this.\n\nNaoya was, without exaggeration, a better written villain than BOTH Sukuna and Kenjaku, and is one of the best written characters in JJK. \n\nHe’s such an incredibly twisted, degenerate piece of shit, and he never relents on that aspect. He wears everything, his complete disregard for love and his disgusting misogyny, on his sleeve and happily accepts himself.\n\nWhat truly makes him so special is just how… simple he is, by comparison. \n\nUnlike Sukuna and ESPECIALLY Kenjaku, who both had immense depth to them that was ultimately squandered by JJK’s writing being extremely rushed post-Shibuya, Naoya is extremely simple, and thus what IS there is perfectly developed.\n\nHe isn’t an ancient sorcerer with a blanket of terror around him, nor is he a body-stealing puppeteer trying to throw the world into chaos. He’s just a power-hungry, selfish, misogynistic bastard at his core.\n\nHowever. While he’s simple by comparison. There IS depth to him. And all of it is wonderfully written.\n\nNaoya, as a rather ‘young’ man, is placed in a similar position as the rest of the protagonists, young people who are set to inherit everything from their elders, good and ESPECIALLY bad. \n\nHowever, unlike the sorcerers, who fight against and reject the cruelty and bigotry of their elders, Naoya happily rejoices in his own and his elder’s corruption. \n\n\nFurthermore, unlike them, Naoya WANTS to inherit it all. All of the power. All of the bigotry. All of the cruelty. Everything.\n\nMaki rejected her family’s misogyny and desire for power.\n\nYuji rejected the evil both Sukuna and Kenjaku tried to impose upon him.\n\nMegumi rejected the Zen’in Clan, especially since they would treat his sister as a slave.\n\nYuta rejected the Jujutsu Higher Ups by refusing to kill Yuji. \n\nSatoru rejected the whole of Jujutsu Society, and wanted to create a new world for his students. \n\n\nAll of them rejected the traditions of the past, but Naoya WANTS that tradition, to the point that when he’s DENIED it, he flies into a rage and plots to murder Megumi. \n\n\nAnother aspect to Naoya’s depth is his ‘relationship’ to Toji. More specifically, how Naoya idolized Toji and outright despised the Zen’in Clan for rejecting him.\n\nSome people think that this is actually a POSITIVE thing for Naoya, and that he was the only one who ‘loved’ Toji.\n\nThat’s not true. Naoya didn’t love Toji. He loved his parasocial IDEA of Toji.\n\nThe idea of Toji as an ultra-masculine, unstoppable force of power. \n\nNaoya didn’t care for who Toji truly was, AKA a completely broken and depressed man.\n\nToji wasn’t some masculine badass. He was a broken shell of a man who had been completely traumatized by the Zen’in Clan, and then effectively flew off the handle once his wife died.\n\nHe became a deadbeat, began relying on various women to support him financially by charming them, and neglected his son. \n\nHe started gambling constantly despite never getting a good payout, and he began assassinating sorcerers, eventually murdering an innocent girl.\n\nToji is compared to the teachings of Zen Buddhism, which focuses on abandoning all worldly desires and pursuing an inner emptiness. \n\nToji DID achieve that inner emptiness, but that emptiness wasn’t a good thing. It was a heartbreaking demonstration of just how thoroughly the Zen’in Clan broke him down and ripped out the innards of his soul. \n\n\nToji wasn’t the kind of man Naoya claimed he loved. He was a traumatized, downright pathetic man who destroyed countless lives and caused a chain-reaction which created the disaster that would eventually get Naoya himself killed.\n\n(Toji is the one who caused Geto’s descent to madness, which later on allowed Kenjaku to steal his body. Kenjaku then sealing Gojo would create the successional crisis in the Zen’in Clan, due to Naobito putting a clause in his will that should Gojo be incapacitated in any way, the Zen’in Clan would go to Megumi, a clause that TOJI HIMSELF forced Naobito to put.) \n\nNaoya, despite seeing himself as superior to the Zen’in Clan for ‘respecting’ Toji, truly was just as bad as they were. \n\nInstead, his disrespect for Toji came in the form of ‘loving’ him. \n\nAlthough… Perhaps Toji being such a pathetic, violent shell of a person is EXACTLY what Naoya loved so much.\n\n(Yes, we’re now talking about his misogyny.)\n\n\nNaoya’s most prominent trait is his EXTREME misogyny. Even by the disgusting standards set by the elders of Jujutsu society, he stands out for just how awful he is.\n\nHe openly claims that women who can’t walk three steps behind men should be stabbed in the back (a statement he would grow to sorely regret) and he only likes Mai over Maki because of Mai’s submissive nature and her chest.\n\nMind you, this is in Chapter 138, Naoya’s FIRST EVER CHAPTER. His INTRODUCTION puts his misogynistic views on full focus. \n\nFurthermore, Volume 17, the art for which I put as the picture of this post. Do you know what Naoya is crushing in his hands?\n\nGege himself confirmed in an interview that it’s a pomegranate.\n\nPomegranates are fruit which have historically been seen as FEMINIST symbols of womanhood empowerment. \n\nEven Naoya’s dedicated volume cover shows his misogyny on full display. Him literally crushing the fruit representing womanhood and licking the juice (which is drawn to resemble blood) with a lecherous smile. \n\n(Furthermore, the background of the cover seemingly shows Film reels, which seems to be a reference to Projection Sorcery, and how Naoya inherited not only that technique from his father, but also the outdated and disgusting views from Naobito.) \n\nNaoya’s distaste for women goes especially to Maki, who he degrades and mocks, even when she shows power equal to Toji himself.\n\nAnd that’s where the implications for Naoya’s love of Toji comes in.\n\nToji is, at his core, a deeply flawed and downright pathetic man. \n\nIn his personal life, he’s a complete failure in every regard. He stopped working normal jobs, relying on women to provide for him, constantly gambled the money he DID have, and didn’t do anything to care for Megumi and Tsumiki. \n\nAs the Sorcerer Killer, however? He’s a force of nature. Able to contend with special grade sorcerers with ease, and was able to almost kill SATORU GOJO himself. \n\nHe was a walking calamity that created a trail of destruction and chaos even after his death. \n\nSo, look at this; A man who is completely unwilling to care for himself and his children, leaving all those duties to the women around him, and having intense power and constantly causing destruction and death around him.\n\n… Doesn’t that sound like the patriarchal ideal for a man? \n\n\nThat’s why Naoya rejected Maki. She didn’t fit the mold that Toji fit in Naoya’s mind.\n\nIt wasn’t just Toji’s power. It was the fact that he fit Naoya’s twisted ideal for what a true man should be. \n\n(That’s also why, if Toji was a woman, Naoya would probably hate her, since his love for Toji was due to Toji fulfilling Naoya’s patriarchal standards for men.) \n\n\n\nHowever, Naoya’s hatred of women ends up being his downfall in many ways. \n\nPrimarily, his statement about women being stabbed in the back comes back to haunt him TWICE. \n\nFirstly, after suffering a humiliating defeat by Maki who had also slaughtered his entire clan, Naoya is stabbed in the back by Maki’s mother, the woman who he said that original statement to. \n\nShe even stabs him with a KITCHEN KNIFE, of all things. \n\nThen, as a Cursed Spirit, Naoya is finally killed permanently by Maki who once again stabs him in the back. \n\nThis time, using the Split Soul Katana, a weapon used originally by Toji, the man that Naoya idolized so much. \n\n\nSpeaking OF his Cursed Spirit form, isn’t it familiar to a certain shape? \n\nYup. It’s a vagina. \n\nIn a twist of ultimate irony, Naoya Zen’in, the ultimate misogynist himself, is reduced to a giant vagina of all things.\n\nSomething which lines up with his cover art, too. Since Pomegranates are also seen as symbols of fertility. \n\n\nAnd it’s here where Naoya’s depravity reaches a new level, where it’s implied that he RAPED Mai. Suddenly, his earlier statement of Mai being ‘buxom’ takes on a far darker tone. \n\nOnce again, it circles back to his volume cover. \n\nThe pomegranate he was crushing? A symbol both of womanhood and fertility? That was MAI he was crushing. \n\nThe blood dripping down? It can even be seen as a symbol of Mai’s hymen. Especially in how Naoya licks it with a leering look of disgusting lust. \n\n(Also, since there’s no real place to add this. But the film reels in the back of the cover are also a reference to his Domain Expansion, where he injects film reels into his victims.) \n\n\nNaoya is a depraved, unforgivable, disgusting man, and how does the narrative treat him?\n\nBy laughing in his face and undermining him at every turn.\n\n\nHis first major loss is against Choso. Here, Naoya expresses the worthlessness of familial love and how he would be willing to murder his own family if it meant getting to the top. \n\nSomething which obviously enrages Choso. \n\nAs a result, Naoya loses against Choso, badly. And in doing so, his own ideology falters against Choso’s. \n\nChoso, the man ironically also born from a disgustingly misogynistic clan, prevailed against Naoya thanks to his ideals of the important of family. \n\nTo add further salt into the wound; Naoya is then forced to grovel at the feet of Yuta Okkotsu, a relative of the Gojo Clan and someone who also wanted the Zen’in Clan exterminated. \n\nA man who, unlike Toji, completely shatters Naoya’s patriarchal views. Yuta is shy, completely respectful of the women in his life, and cares for the wellbeing of everyone around him.\n\nHe’s a man who is so completely against Naoya’s standards, yet manages to dwarf him in everything. \n\nMegumi, the man Naoya wanted dead for daring to deny him the right of being Clan head, literally DOESN’T EVEN KNOW HIM. He never sees him. \n\n\nThen, of course, Naoya is humiliated and killed by the very women he undermined time and time again. And all of his dreams and ambitions burn to ash as they do so. \n\nHis final death is also symbolic. If Naoya truly did rape Mai, then him being stabbed in the back by Maki is truly a fitting way to go.\n\nThink about it. He, as a giant vagina, was penetrated by a hard object. \n\nIt’s a metaphor for sex. (Especially since, apparently, Maki’s words to him asking for a hug during their battle have a sexual connotation to them in their original Japanese.) \n\nAnd the fact that Naoya was stabbed in the back by the Split Soul Katana is just icing on the cake. That sword was associated with Toji and by extension, the toxic patriarchal views Naoya held towards him. \n\nThus, a vagina being stabbed by that sword is symbolic of Naoya’s harm towards women, and how he violated Mai. So, the final act to slaughter him was a recreation of that very same patriarchy. \n\nAll of which done by Maki, the woman who Naoya hated so much, and whose Heavenly Restriction meant that his domain saw her as an object, and thus couldn’t detect her.\n\nNaoya Zen’in, in the end, was killed by his own misogyny. He saw Maki and the other women in his life as objects to conquer, abuse, and even rape to his heart’s content, and that attitude is what got him killed.", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

While I agree that his death was sudden, I think Gege gave Gojo a fitting end. A common point of contention is Nanami calling Gojo selfish, but the story itself consistently portrayed Gojo as selfish. He’s always loved fighting and using his powers while playing with his enemies, and while he did choose to raise up the next generation, it was mostly because he felt lonely at the top. Something having a positive impact doesn’t mean the motivations behind it weren’t selfish. Nanami calling him a weirdo also makes sense because he can’t relate to why Gojo does things since he hates doing his job but does it anyway for the sake of others.

While killed offscreen, he was still reunited with Getou and got to die to worthy opponent like he wanted. Sukuna's last words and Gojo's last smile made it bearable. He seems happy to be dead and I think, even though he didn't say it, he trusted his students to carry on.  Nanami's comment was irritating, but I saw it more as him misunderstanding Gojo rather than a correct presumption of his character. He loved his students and wished the best for them.\n\nIt's why 261-262 is so irritating. They took his death and shit on it. They made it seem like he's nothing but a meat shield. His students basically expected him to die.  They failed him. His dream was for his students to surpass him and take the jujutsu world with their own hands. But even dead, they use him as a weapon. It's sad the way they can't make it on their own, but need to take his corpse and pile all their problems onto it once more. Even with his consent, it's depressing.\n\nI don't blame Yuta. He's the only one that hated using Gojo's corpse like that, not because the act was wrong but because of his love for his teacher. It was  a desperate backup plan, but it's disgusting the way noone but Yuta had the balls to take up Gojo's burden as the human weapon. \n\nI don't think Yuta is going to win, not because he's a fraud, but because according to tradition, Yuji as the MC should be the one to defeat him. He'll severely damage Sukuna, but I think Yuji will get the last blow. With the 5 min time limit, I hope Yuta doesn't die but I don't want him to live as Gojo forever. \n\nI don't think Gojo is coming back, but still. God, Gege. Just let the man die in peace. I don't care what anyone says, regardless of whether he would have won to Sukuna or how his students throw his dead body around, he earned the title as the strongest because he was Gojo Satoru. His Six Eyes and Limitless helped, but if he wasn't Gojo Satoru, a man who wanted to help his students grow, took on the burdens of those he loved, and wanted to change the Jujutsu World for the better, he would just be another Sukuna.", "assistant": "Read the rules.

Yuta IS strong, and I won't deny that he's top 5-7 at least.\nYuta is one of the only characters that seems to me is just a \"Hey we don't have enough strong characters so throw this guy in\" character to me, and overall just feels like a boring character. I'll get reiterate again, I don't deny that he's strong, it's just that he isn't a fun or inspired character. He has practically everything handed to him (second highest CE reserves, a cursed spirit pet that was literally a \"get out of death free card,\" and his Cursed technique is literally just \"I can copy people's cursed technique.\" He also bags Maki) And barely puts effort in to get stronger. I also think I would've enjoyed him more if he had more interactions (that aren't just glazing and sweating while looking at everyone yap among themselves) with others to add substance to his character\n\nPeople might respond by saying Yuji is just a punch/kick merchant, but he has actual development in the story, he HAS some substance to hold onto. Yuta's character is \"I'm very humble and nice but also super strong\" as if he were the most cliche Shonen MC. It doesn't feel like he's earned literally any of his power, unlike Sukuna, who crawled his way to the top, Gojo, who faced near death experiences to learn RCT and Purple, Y(W)uji, who has been in the trenches ever since he became a sorcerer, and Kenjaku, who planned for over 1000 years and stole a bums body (sorry Geto glazers) and transformed that CT to peak. I'd go on, but I feel like the point was made\n\nI'd like to end this by saying if you like Yuta, that's cool. I'm not gonna hate on you for liking a fictional character, I just want people to see where most Yuta slander comes from (at least on my side.)\nIm also open to arguments saying that he isinteresting, i just cant read.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Gojo fans are ruining this fight\n\nI’ll just point out now, “Gojo fans” in this post is referring to the more toxic individuals rather than every Gojo fan as a whole.\n\nGojo vs Sukuna is a confrontation that has been hyped since the start of the manga. I understand fans are very passionate about this fight and coming into it, I thought this would’ve been the peak of discussion and interaction within the JJK community. Unfortunately the hardcore Gojo fans have been ruining this fight (for me at the very least).  I don’t have a problem with memes. I actually found the Gojover and Fraudkuna memes to be quite funny at the start. However, it is now just getting played out and overdone. Gojo fans have completely decided to throw away the idea of looking at the fight analytically and are instead just trying to push their agenda and narrative at every turn.\n\nBecause of the nature of how the fight is setup, Sukuna is REQUIRED to take hits in order for the wheel to adapt. This has created an illusion in the mind of Gojo fans that Gojo can just easily ragdoll and beatdown Sukuna whenever he wants when that is clearly not what Gege is implying. I’ve said several times that Gojo is only able to beatdown Sukuna when Sukuna turns off domain amplification to setup mahoraga’s wheel. There are now SEVERAL examples in the fight that prove this point. The intention of the wheel is to be a double edged sword which provides Sukuna a chance at bypassing infinity, but also puts him at risk at the same time. In the eyes of Gojo fans though, all they see is Gojo beating down Sukuna while ignoring the mechanics behind the interaction. This has been a common trend throughout the entire fight. When Gojo does something cool or lands a hit, he’s an amazing god and clearly dominating. When Sukuna gains the advantage, he’s fraud or “it’s fine, it’s not a problem for goatjo.” \n\nThe newest chapter is a perfect example of this. People are so focused on the process that they’re completely ignoring the end result. Once again we’re shown that domain amplification allows Sukuna to withstand Gojo’s attacks and the moment he turns it off he is at Gojo’s mercy. Gojo knocks out Sukuna with a black flash (I’m assuming he’s knocked out but maybe he’ll be fine next chap like when he got hit with void) and that’s all the Gojo fans will tunnel vision on of course. Doesn’t matter that mahoraga has now fully adapted to limitless as Sukuna planned. Doesn’t matter that Sukuna no longer has a reason to purposely take hits from Gojo to adapt. Doesn’t matter that Sukuna can now use his own techniques or keep domain amplification on permanently. It’s just, “Gojo is clearly stomping Sukuna and Sukuna is running away to mahoraga.”\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with supporting and rooting for your character but when you throw away all reasoning and ignore what is being presented for the sake of pushing your agenda, that’s when it gets problematic. And it’s not even a loud minority that you can just ignore. It’s no secret that there are way more Gojo fans than Sukuna fans so you have to see that shit everywhere you look. Even youtubers have shown a clear bias and the ones who were pretending to be neutral are revealing themselves. It’s honestly quite sad cause I was a big Gojo fan myself and his fans have actively made it harder for me to enjoy his character. I went from wanting an equal fight where one side eventually wins to wanting to see Gojo get absolutely destroyed just to shut up the toxic fans. \n\nJJK is a battle manga that lends itself to interesting discussions and analysis, yet the fanbase has dissolved to just memeing and joking around instead of properly appreciating what should be the peak of the manga’s fights and it’s honestly been disappointing. That’s just my opinion though. Maybe you don’t have a problem with the community’s recent behavior and it hasn’t hurt your enjoyment of the fight. Let me know.", "assistant": "Wdym, Gojo and Sukuna fans are simply emulating the manga by having a battle themselves.\n\nA battle of agenda’s, that is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uv1owprooib1.jpeg?width=1118&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a2db0909f93c0714aaaeded62587fd5ba2e2b9e\n\nHave you ever seen such opposition, gaslighting, slander, shit posting before ?\n\nWho will back down first, who can make more shit posts, can fraudkuna become a Google recommendation when the word fraud is searched for ?\n\nPerhaps, the real sorcery fight was the fandom we built along the way"}

And also this panel explains it all. Also to say gege is a sukuna glazer, did you actually read the manga panels? You can obviously see how much he had glazed gojo before, only making him lose to sukuna doesn't make him a sukuna glazer. Also sukuna tanked gojo's purple. If he adapted to it from mahoraga, what would now the fight happen. Gojo needed purple and sukuna had adapted, what now?\nAlso saying Megumi is bum comes mainly from gojo fans because - \"he is the reason sukuna defeated gojo.\" \nNow if someone replied with nuh uh or didn't read or DOWNVOTE this, just shows how mentally insane you have become..\n\nThanks for listening\n\nAlso source for the mod who would remove it because of no source - it is a panel from ch-236", "assistant": "Read the rules.

Accept it.\n\nIk its a dumb thing to post something srs on this sub but for the few who will read it, here we go.\n\nWhat do you think it takes to stay at the TOP of jujutsu world? Only the personal Cursed Technique? Hell no. It takes battle exp, battle iq and knowing how to use ur tools and weapons to ur advantages. Since sukuna is a villai who doesnt feel for anyone or anything apart from himself. He is willing to use OTHERS and THEIRS TOOLS+CT to his advantage.\n\nSukuna is not a bad villain just bcuz he is using everything he can get his hands on and use them to win fights.\n\nThe previous limitless+sexy eyes user was also defeated by a 10S user (who didnt have mahoraga) so there EXISTS a way to get around infinity without Strong Dismantle. Sukuna was the first person to tame maho and saw he can modify his already op technique even further. So he just did. Even if Sukuna didnt have maho, its already proven that 10S user has a way around infinity. \n\nIf you just rely on ur personal CT and energy. Eventually someone will show up who counters ur CT perfectly and will take u out. And remember Sukuna fought like a 100 different sorcerers of HEIAN era which was golden era of jujutsu. Even then he was using cursed tools like his trident and shit. \n\nThe way sukuna has reigned on top is having the biggest arsenal of techniques and feats possible. He had:\n\nCursed tools\n4 hands 2 Mouths\nDismantle+Cleave\nBarrier-less domain\nBlack Box technique\nBottomless cursed energy\nRCT\n\nIn the current arc Sukuna is using all of his weapons one by one accordingly. He isnt just laying all his cards in front of his enemies so they can counter it. Its a tactical play. In his fight against KasHIMo the first thing sukuna did was hand to hand, but kashimo due to his CT was better than sukuna so he realized he will need 4 arms to counter him which he did. Hence he regenerated himself and his cursed technique. Even then he didnt instantly use a domain or strong Dismantle. First he used the tool. Well that didnt work either so now lets play the next card. Strong Dismantle. Kashimo lost his hand. Now Sukuna knows he can finish off kashimo with it so he PLAYS a lil hand to hand with him which turns out to be completely 1-sided in Sukuna's favour. Ofc he got bored. Threw kashimo behind and Strong Dismantled him. Simple.\n\nSukuna doesnt care about fair fighting. There are no fair fights in Jumpjutsu kaisen. Its all about who can win. And sukuna will use anything and anyone he can to win. All these dumbass calling sukuna (and comparing him to someone as lame as muzan) a fraud and bad villain for not using his own CT. Bro he is using all his cards one by one according to situation. Thats how he has defeated 100 different sorcerers with 100 diff techniques. Not all of them were 1on1 either. He fought groups and armies ALONE.", "assistant": "Read the rules. The new chapter leaks must be flaired the orange \"new chapter spoilers\".

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Hatsune Miku in JJK (this is a long one)\n\nBackstory: The Inumaki clan, while powerful, could never hope to reach the heights of the big three families, one girl sought to change that. Her name was Hatsune Inumaki, born with the clan classic cursed speech but blessed also with the legendary six eyes, something only believed to belong to the Gojo clan, but this could be their ticket to set themselves up to be on the level of the other clans. She was kept hidden, often trained for hours at time from her strict schedule and was allowed very few breaks, not that it mattered since she'd find her ways of sneaking out via paralyzing her trainers with the “don't move” command and running off into the city in search of her one comfort being old retro stores who'd let people walk in and listen to music of some artists and groups from inland or abroad. She couldn't understand the words or who this M… J… person was truly, but his music through their beats alone would move her. Through this her life goal was set, she would go to Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer and once she's getting paid for her work, she'll leave her clan and pursue music. The process was swift and Hatsune Inumaki burst onto the scene of the Jujutsu world and at the same time Satoru Gojo would as well, two six eyes wielders met for the first time in history and the higher-ups took note and didn't like what they saw. Two powerhouses was too much of a risk for them to control in the near future, so they needed one gone and Hatsune was going to be that sacrifice so as to not anger one of the big three families (familial bias too). So a trap was set, she was sent on a mission and ambushed by a finger bearer. Her training served her well, but the difference in their cursed energy made it so the curse could exploit her one weakness of lacking rct, but came out victorious. But as she was bleeding out, dying slowly she cursed her family, cursed the higher ups and the system that wouldn't allow her to live the dream that kept her going, she begged to survive, unintentionally making a binding vow to give up her six eyes for survival. She'd awaken once more as a curse, a faded mass of cursed energy next to her body, her binding vow had worked seeing as it was healed, the heart beat, it breathed, but it was just that a body like newly bought car waiting for a new driver to take it, she'd be that driver and would go into hiding as she's now considered dead. Her dreams were now possible, she could be someone new, with a new, unknown future ahead, then it hit her. Out of spite of her clan and hope for her time to come, Hatsune Miku was born and she was an instant sensation, albums and commercial deals galore. Loyal followers and cosplayers take the world by storm in all countries. On some level, Mike had become a name said at least once through every city and town, fans screaming her name in adoration from everywhere she looked. Finally, the world is hers.\n\nAbilities: “Hatsune Miku” is an unregistered special grade cursed spirit though mostly docile, even friendly unless threatened. Its true form is a mass of densely packed cursed energy and has unpredictable movement patterns, having showings all over the world, sometimes in completely different signatures from different sides of the globe. This curse has the uncanny ability to copy itself a seemingly unlimited amount of times and the possessed bodies take on similar features such as blue hair and blue eyes. Its current number of hosts is unknown.\n\nRevised Cursed Technique - Vocaloid: unlike its parent technique, this one can't be used with the user’s cursed energy, but rather from those who are fans of her. This limitation allows for an added potency of her speech when in song. Her intent when singing turns into reality, whether it be to hypnotize her followers further and coax others into her music, or to send the physical manifestations of her notes to her target as projectiles, the sky is the limit. She must maintain her harmony for her technique to remain active. \n\nDE: Like the domain of Megumi Fushiguro, it is incomplete, but its range is noticeably large. Through this her technique can be amplified ten fold despite lacking a sure hit. However, if you want to stand on its surface without falling into its abyss is you have to remain in harmony with Miku through your voice or through the standard domain countermeasures. Beware, the domain is made out of a large amount of cursed energy and a high output, leading to opponents losing during their clashes with their own domains. Only god knows what can happen once she figures out how to create a shell\n\nFirst pic: @cnasDryNa\nSecond pic: @doodly_sherry on X\nThird pic: @_swt2 on X\nFourth pic: @TheAzureCiel on X\nFifth pic: @asrikuna (sry if I mispelled this, but this one was old in my gallery)", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Gege is right, and all of you are wrong\n\nAlright, to preface: I'm aware that memes and real feelings have a tendency to mix up and present an inaccurate picture. I know that most people do genuinely believe that Gege is still very good and like his decisions and where he's taking the story, but I still wanna take aim at many of the hotly contested talking points.\n\nAnd yes, I do believe that JJK should have more character moments; this is more towards story and character decisions - taken within the context of the story and the author's intent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YUKI IS WASTED**\n\nThe reason people care so much about Yuki is because of her being special grade. While her death was, yes, a bit cheap, consider her role though:\n\n1. Kenjaku had yet to have a proper fight. Him beating a strong opponent was detrimental to his reputation as a main villain.\n2. Yuki exists to plug the obvious plot-hole: why does nobody try to nip cursed spirits from the bud? As in, make sure they don't appear in the first place? The answer was, someone did try: Yuki.\n3. Yuki is a special grade in a story bloated with them. Spending a long time on every single one is far from ideal.\n4. Yuki is very powerful. Building on the last, she has to be balanced somehow. Either she dies here or gets a cheap death later. If not a cheap death, then it doesn't make sense for her not to be too dominant against Sukuna and take the spotlight away from other character, unless you scale his power way up (and then have to scale the others up and down...and now we have an ever messier situation) or cheapen her, which is worse.\n\nAnd this is not to mention her short but important feats, like saving everyone at shibuya, her role in Geto and Todo's development, female special grade representation etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MEGUMI \"POTENTIAL MAN\" (ft. HAKARI, KASHIMO, HIGUMURA etc.)**\n\nMegumi being constantly alluded to has having the potential to be great is one of the most memed things as he, well, always falls short. And...that's the point. He is supposed to be  a character with untapped potential who through his own doubts, as well as external circumstances, just...didn't.\n\nThe other people with \"the potential to surpass Gojo Satoru\" are in the same boat. They very well *could*, but what made Gojo special was that he was a rarety in a rarety. While others died, never realized their full potential, or otherwise, Gojo survived and thrived. THAT is why by the end he was the strongest: he was still around to use his talents. In another world, Toji succesfully killed him and Gojo simply joined the potential man ranks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TSUMIKI WAS TREATED ONLY LIKE A PLOT POINT**\n\nYes, she was. Throughout the whole story, she holds emotional significance to our characters, yet the cruelty is that because of our villains, she's never elvoles more than a plot point. The ugly reality is what makes her very impactful and serves to drive in the unfairness of the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE \"INTERNATIONAL STUFF\" WAS A MISTAKE**\n\nAgain, plugging plot holes. The foreign countries' reaction to cursed spirits had to be acknowledged *somehow.* And it was. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**KENJAKU'S DEATH WAS TOO EASY/CHEAP**\n\nWhile, yes, it was Yuta who delivered the final blow, make no mistake: this was undoubtedly Takaba's victory. The culmination of their chapters long fight, and cementing Takaba as one of the only people in the verse to live up to the lofty hype centered around them. \n\nIt would throw water over everything Takaba achieved if Yuta still had to struggle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GOJO GETTING \"OFF-SCREENED\" WAS A BAD DECISION** \n\nWorld cleave was the culmination of everything Sukuna did during the fight. Fighting Gojo, waiting for Mahagora to adapt to infinity, Mahagora cutting Gojo's arm off, nobody can deny that it was at least properly set up.\n\nThe main point of contention is that it's used off screen.\n\nConsider this: was the contrast between the end of the previous chapter and the one with Gojo's death not  a whiplash? That was the point. Both men stood triumphant at the success of their plans, yet we didn't know that about Sukuna yet. Whatever the conditions for world cleave, whether Sukuna pulled it out in a second and there was nothing to show anyway or there was a brief battle, doesn't matter. Sukuna had earned it and the battle was over anyway. And I personally believe it *was* just a matter of seconds between Gojo's celebration and world cleave. Just my opinion though.\n\n**SUKUNA \"GLAZING\" AND EX-MACHINAS**\n\nThis one is more minor, since it's mostly jokes, but bears mentioning. \n\nIf you look at his presence across the story, he honestly hasn't been around much. Two shenanigan sessions around the start with megumi and then appearing for real in Shibuya. Then gone again till he used enchain. Considering that he's one of the two main villains, I think him getting extra special attention is a bit deserved.\n\nAs far as his heian era ex-machina's go, they might feel a bit goofy but look at what they do: give each character a role. If he has a x tools, each of our heroes can divide the work x/n amongst themselves. For example, higumura taking out his cursed tool, Yuta taking out his extra arms and mouth. Slowly, our heroes whittle him down, and each one gets their moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n&#x200B;", "assistant": "Read the rules.

Here is why.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5ag5elp7gyc1.jpg?width=1460&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8093e01c863c6a6506f3fcf16615a38195510654\n\n\n\n\"Overthrowing/Destroying a country\" right ?\n\nit WOULD have made sense... if the story was taking place in the 1800s.\n\nThe thing is, except beside Gojo (and Yuki if you take the black hole into account), none of the Special Grade can. a point could be made for Geto but the thing is, after 5 years of collecting curses, he could only take on 2 cities. even if there was no Jujutsu Sorcerers, you could just... bomb the cities as a last resort.\n\nThat's the thing, the military is actually powerful. Sure the military couldnt deal with the Culling Games, but that was a massive plan prepared over decades to be able to setup these barriers.\n\nThink about Yuta versus Spain for exemple. he has great firepower, sure. he has a domain. he probably has barriers technique that could stop some airstrikes. but he wont be able to do it FOREVER. he'll eventually get bombed to oblivion and die.\n\nEven Sukuna would lose this. Most of his destructive abilities is his Domain, which, if i remember correctly, is only around 300 meters of radius. and he cannot open that many in a row, or he runs out of Cursed Energy. +, his CT will get burned out after a domain and he'll be vulnerable to Missiles and bombings.\n\nBy the way, i'm not saying \"the plot makes no sense, the military could have solved it\" because in the scope of Jujutsu Kaisen, it makes sense that in a lot of situations we see, the miliary wouldnt be able to do much.\n\nBut in the scenario of a sole sorcerer with prep time attacking an entire country, they'll destroy a few cities and die. Mangakas sometime forget how powerful a military actually is, one of the reasons i love HxH so much. they just nuked the antagonist.\n\nGojo would be the only one to survive, as he litterally cant be harmed\n\nAnd before anyone say \"they could also take over but not through brute force\" yeah sure but then you dont need to be a sorcerer to do that, does that mean that anyone with incredible charisma is a special grade ? obviously not, it was always obvious that it was meant as in fighting the country head-on.\n\nAlso, i am pretty sure the higher ups had no clue Yuki had the Black-hole in the first place. but let's be real, that's one of the least absurd thing about the Black Hole so suuuure. but that kinda mean that \"overthrowing a country\" isnt the Higher Ups' definition of Special Grade, only Kenjaku's.\n\nSorry for all the yapping and the bad english, i'm not a native english speaker.\n\nhope yall have a nice day !", "assistant": "Read the rules.

If seen people say that “Oh Yuji would remind Geto of Haibara” That only happens for like three minutes. Haibara was generally a pretty mellow person who didn’t put too much thought into what he was doing as a sorcerer, completely different from Yuji who’s motive for being a sorcerer was so strong that he overcame Sukuna in a battle of ideology.\n\nGeto sees little to no value in normal humans. To him they are parasites that feed off the strong until the strong are so drained that they are devoured. Yuji especially towards the end of the series believes that even the most shut in individual’s life is precious. To Geto, Yuji is not just endangering the lives of sorcerers by trying to protect the weak but the very idea that normal people’s lives have value inherently equal to a sorcerer’s would enrage him. \n\nOn the other hand, Geto’s belief that life in the hands of a non sorcerer is a worthless thing and that only the chosen few deserve to live would be an idea completely opposed to Yuji’s journey. Geto’s belief in a chosen people of sorcerers is disgusting to Yuji because Yuji believes even the frailest person’s life is blessed. Geto would hate Yuji more than Yuta for sure. Yuta kinda ended up following Geto in a way, Yuta does whatever it takes to protect his chosen people (his loved ones) just like Geto. Yuji saves the lives of his chosen people (everyone) while refusing to give up his humanity. \n\nLet me know what you think", "assistant": "This is an automated message under every post and has nothing to do with your post specifically.\n\nReminder to read the rules before posting, and IF your post contains spoilers for a leaked chapter, make sure the spoilers are not in the title and the post is flaired New Chapter Spoilers.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/jujutsufolk. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "I like gojo but i hate his community\n\n...\n\nOk i'll start. What i'll say will cause a lot of hate i think but anyway. There's 75% of this sub that is gojo fans. And in these 75% there's 50% hardcore obsessed gojo fans. These gojo fans are à true scourge to this community. Lemme explain (the pictures will have a paragraph to them with a number: 1.. 2. 3...., make sure to read with the picture!):\n\nRemember chapter 260? Yea it was pretty sick. Todo returns, yuji Cook but there's a problem: there’s gojo. This is the problem. gege just killed himself by showing gojo this way. There's no timeline when the next chapter will be appreciated. And all of that because of these hardcore gojo fans. If they see gojo then gojo HAVE to comeback. But its like no one is understanding that gojo dont have to come back AT ALL. Let yuji Shine. No, let gojo's student shine! This is his legacy! This is one of the difference beetween sukuna and gojo. Gojo wants to share his power! He want the other to become as strong as he is! Sukuna is selfish and when he'll die, there will be no remnants of him. Its not the case in gojo because even if he died. His legacy is still alive. Its like an extension of gojo himself. But people cannot be satisfied about that because there's brainrot gojo fans that will complain again and again since they do not see gojo ALIVE. I know that some will answer \"yea but yuji shine for 3 months\". Yea 3 months... gojo shine since the manga start. Its been for years...\n\n\nIn their mind if gojo is not here ---> trash writing \nBut if gojo comeback OH MY GOD ITS PEAK!!!!\n \n\nLike i said chapter 260 killed chapter 261 because of gojo. And now, from nowhere there's an explosion of hate about shoko.(2)  \"Shoko is a bum. Shoko didnt even care about gojo's death or nanami's death or ... death..\"\n\"Shoko dont give à fuck to gojo\"\nIts weird because people just notice that at chapter 261 🤔. Why no one was complaining about her before???? Why because shoko didnt bring gojo back to life or give a fuck to him she's a  bum??? Why shoko wasnt a bum since 261???? I think that everyone knows why...\n\nWhat is ridiculous is that people thinks that they can be better at manga writing than gege... and what is worse is that they just have to bring back gojo to make them a better mangaka than akutami. And its always like that.. gojo didnt make gojo comeback in 261.\n\nPost before 261 leaks : \"why gojo returns in 261 make sense 🤓\"(3)\n\nPost after 261 leaks: \"why 261 is garbage 🤓\"(4)\nBro cannot understand that gojo soul left his body. He cannot understand this simple thing. \n\n\"261 in an alternate univers\"(5)(gojo comeback)\nThe comments(6): \"wow its so peak, its canon\" etc....\n\nIm not that good in english but i hope yall are understanding what im saying when i say that these people are a scourge. These fucking people are brainrot. They just want to suck the gojo's cock like brainless and thats all. So yea FUCK you all. If you cant hold the fact that gojo is not coming back to 261 then why are you trading jjk? Yall are masochistic??? Why gege is receiving so much hate because your and my King is not comming back huh? And why shoko is à bum JUST in 261??? All of that is because of gojo fans!!! ALL!!! \"Why shoko didnt just healed gojo\" BRO FUCK YOU SHE CANNOT BRING BACK SOMEONE TO LIFE SHE S A HEALER NOT SUNG JIN WOO.\n\nGojo is now like a weapon in 261. Its a bit violent to gojo fans.. understable. But if u cannot read something \"that violent\" then go read mikey mouse and co. Everything cannot be sweet and sugar. And thats why you're reading this manga huh? Or you just want everyone to comeback and jjk transform into fairy tail??? Oh... but the scourge dont want everyone to comeback they want especially gojo! The other lmfao we dont care right? \n\nCan you just stop give an opinion for a whole manga just because your goat is not coming back? Can you all just understand that if gojo come back it'll actually be trash because his legacy will be useless if he's back??? I know that you reaaaaaally like him but gojo is not jjk. He's even not the MC. Before 260 everyone was hyped for yuji!!!! But yuta came back with gojo's body... its a little bit annoying but keep in mind that probably the last time we're seeing Yuta ALIVE. So lets just let him Cook and thats all. And stop complaining about gojo. You can Cope!!! But talking trash about a whole manga and à mangaka because gojo didnt came back i cant.", "assistant": "Read the rules. The new chapter leaks must be flaired the orange \"new chapter spoilers\".

Sukuna tries his best to ruin Yuji’s “privileged” life and finds his unbreakable nature boring.\n\nYuji knows that Sukuna has this hatred of him and the world that ostracized him. Because of that, Yuji only wanted to talk to Sukuna even after everything.\n\nAnd even if you don’t believe that was the intention, Is it so far fetched to think that Yuji never thought to give it a name? This isn’t One Piece (no offense) where a named attack inflicts more damage and I think Yuji gets that.

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Gojo fans are hypocrites\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts criticising the writing as of late, and you know what? They are right...  However, they do not have the right to complain about it, and you know why? Because they only begun caring about it after gojo lost. This fight was handled really badly from the start, everyone wanted to see full power sukuna vs full power gojo, instead, we got coward meguna running for daddy mahoraga vs gojo who didn't die in 4 chapters because of luck (prison realm), but gojo fans were alright with it because it portrayed gojo in a better light, hence why they're hypocrites.\n\nIf a sukuna fan made a comment about how the fight was too onesided to be enjoyable, people would clown on them, tell them to cope, and post that live heian era meme. If they said sukuna shouldn't die without using the black box and heian form, gojo fans would just say it was ok not to show them, and they wouldn't matter anyway, they did not care about sukuna not having cool moments, all they cared about was gojo wining.\n\n And now that gojo inevitably lost, they all of a sudden have a problem with the rest of the fight being onesided, textbook definition of not caring about something untill it happens to you. People never had problem with wasting a character, as long as it was a character they didn't like, they never had a problem with asspulls as long as it was their character doing it (domain healing, small domain, adlib purple). No one cared if sukuna got no ct reveal and no backstory or heian flashback, or about squandering yuji's fight with sukuna if he died to gojo, but now gojo  having undeveloped plot points is bad all of a sudden? Where were the fraud gege posts when they said gojo won?\n\n The writing and structuring was bad from the start, there should have been no meguna, no prison realm buff, no mahoraga, no holding back, and it should have been a back and forth like kashimo vs hakari. So there wasn't anything to like on the fight other than agenda, so i'll at least have that bit of enjoyment, gojo fans are simply getting what was done to sukuna, and i have no fucks to spare for them, both as a fan of sukuna, and as reader.", "assistant": "Ok but wuji fans aren't\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t3g5nk1vmpb1.png?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6224cf7be9479faa9416178df57b15f46576e08b\n\nInvest on wuji stocks today"}

Maybe both are affected by childhood bias, bigger people appearing older than they are, but we have no other hints so Im taking it to mean he couldn't have been younger than 18/20 at either time.\n(Especially because if hes any younger than 15 at either moment means Megumi was the result of a teenage pregnancy and as funny as that sounds, it messes with how old Toji shows himself during the Star Plasma Vessel mission).\n\nWe don't actually know when he left the Zenin clan either, could've been at 18, could've been at 20-something, could've been later.

Takaba's reaction made me feel sad for him, he knew Hanezoki and had lots of fun joking around and annoying for the giggles. The Way Hanezoki was killed is also brutal, stabbed through the neck from all directions not even being decapitated .

Without them, you are basically shipping blind. In my experience, good eval workflows catch issues before they hit production, shorten iteration cycles, and prevent those “works in testing, fails in prod” disasters.\n\nAt Maxim AI we’ve seen teams slash AI feature rollout time just by setting up continuous eval loops with both human and automated tests. If your AI product handles real user-facing tasks, you cannot rely on spot checks. You need evals that mimic the exact scenarios your users will throw at the system.\n\nWhat’s your take, are evals an engineering must-have or just a nice-to-have?", "assistant": "Something worth adding is that you ideally want high sample sizes with real-world data, regardless of your model parameters. I've been regularly evaluating models for different tasks in our product, and it's not rare for a model to behave properly in 490/500 samples, but catastrophically fail in the remaining 10/500. If you're only doing 10 samples, you only have a 19.3% chance of catching that behavior.\n\nIn case you're wondering what I mean by \"catastrophically failing\", I'm talking about scenarios such as the model continuing a conversation instead of summarizing it as instructed."}

The new replication crisis.\n\n**(Please read the whole thing before you hate on me. Or just skip the hating on me.)**\n\nWe're leaving the G out of A G I.\n\nThis isn't about impatience, this is about trajectory. I don't see any evidence of focus even being a goal, let alone a near or mid term foreseeable outcome.\n\nKinda tired of 47,000 models. Been thinking about this and variety is not the spice of life, versatility is. Are we even aiming in a direction of load following models? I don't have to download a specific version of a specific game for my specific hardware. I just get the game and it performs as well as it can for what I give it.\n\nDo we even want that for this tech someday? Again I see no efforts leaning in that direction. Is that because it's impossible? Or is it because no one cares?\n\nSaying I want one best model, or for at least that to be the goal, is not saying I want to force one use case. It means I want one model that can do it all or CLEAR specialists for specific mutually exclusive niche use cases. The whole power of prompting imo is that various prompts give various utilities from one application.\n\nThis is a natural monopoly space imo. We don't want a dozen search engines, we want one that really works.\n\nThat's the entire point of GPT. The Variety should be in prompt response, not prompt receivers. The Variety should be Versatility.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate all the work, and I'm not being entitled, I'm saying the direction of spamming models with incremental changes, to a thousand versions, to be run with a thousand different settings, and a thousand different prompt structures means virtually no real play testing of any given configuration.\n\nThat's why there's this push to streamline testing because we're having to compare and contrast too many models and it's unsustainable. What's the model per month rate now? You can bet it's going up. Is that really considered a good thing intrinsically or are we just assuming any progress is good progress?\n\nIs there any way to combine models? Is shooting for the best of at least pair of worlds something no one cares about but me? How much duplication of effort is already in play?\n\nCan we at least get some kind of list of models that have been completely obviated? Everyone is all about the leaderboard but we need a loser board too. Some culling.\n\nI feel like we're in a new replication crisis where everyone wants to make the next model but no one is working on a core model as a group. It's like how there's all these linux distros but no one has ever really worked on a distro meant to unseat windows. This is an ancient debate and I hate seeing it happen again in this context.\n\nStable diffusion is having a similar problem. Millions of niche models and control nets and loras when we'd all be better off if all the effort were aimed at a core model that just works better.\n\nCan someone explain to me without being a snarky ideolog why this can't be done? Are we talking about mutual exclusivity here? Is it literally not possible to focus? It's weird how models don't even have a mechanism for being updated. It's never like wizard version 2 it's always wizard-orca-magicpants-manticore-64-b-k-5-M.bin. \n\nI understand the need for variation for hardware configurations, but I'm definitely burning out with all the seemingly meaningless choices.\n\nI feel no closer to my virtual D&D game than I was a month ago.", "assistant": "Come back in 2 years then.

As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA (GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.", "assistant": "Has anyone used it? If so review please"}

These findings provide empirical evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future open source deployments\n\nThe gpt-oss-120 was interesting, but I am beyond perplexed how they decided to compare it against other much larger models like some sort of apples to apples comparison.

(Part 2)\n\nI did more testing on OSS20B and worked on my benchmarks and used it more, and it's a weird model to me.\n\nMy previous bench was heavy in a task that OSS does really well that is related to information retrival in structured text, something I use a lot, e.g. when creating NPC D&D character sheet or I'm looking through code documentation. I rebalanced with more tasks variety, and accuracy of OSS went way down.\n\nAs suggested in the previous post, I tried Qwen 3 14B Q6, and accuracy went slightly up, still hovering around 0.7. I would have to rerun the Q4 benchmark to have a apple to apple comparison, but it looks like  Qwen 3 14B performs better on my bench now with higher Q and more varied tests\n\nSpeed wise it's SUPER weird. If you look at the chart you notice something weird. I plotted both T/s and C/s. The gap closes a lot if you look at Char/s instead of T/s. I looked into it, and it's because Qwen has stronger tokens that compress 1:4 to characters, while OSS has much weaker tokens that compress around 1:1.2 to character. Meaning the same token per second from Qwen will result in over 3X the character per second speed. And that closes the gap a lot. Qwen isn't nearly as slow as it seems if you just look at the T/s charts. My guess is due to the chinese dataset training that required more tokens to represent.\n\nAnother weird behaviour is the thinking. OSS seems to work by using Reasoning tags, and if I use OSS without streaming, I cannot turn off thinking. But if I stream with /nothink, the thinking seems to go away. I'm using LM Studio as backend to run the actual model, and I'm using API with my python harness so that it's model independent.", "assistant": "Most horibble visual I have seen in a while"}

It is very picky. And it is not mainly based on Python. Your mileage may vary.)\n\nMeta’s new Llama 4 Maverick 400B and Llama 4 Scout 109B are FAR BEHIND much smaller models in DevQualityEval v1.0 💔😿\n\n\n\nThere are lots of positive and negative details!\n\n\n\n**Results for DevQualityEval v1.0**\n\nMeta: Llama 4 Maverick 400B (best Llama so far, but still mid-level):\n\n* 🏁 Maverick (68.47%) is on #41 (**slightly better than Llama 3.1 405B** \\#48: 65.38%) behind Gemma 3 27B #37 (73.90%), Mistral 3.1 Small (2503) 24B #35 (74.38%) and Qwen: Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B #19 (81.32%)\n* 🐕‍🦺  With better context Maverick (89.70%) would be as good as Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2024-10-22) #2 (89.19%) and ChatGPT-4o (2025-03-27) #1 (90.96%) but reaches only #18 (+21.23%!) since other models can take advantage of better context as well. **This increase is notable and suggests that Maverick (and Scout) can perform much better by default with some fine-tuning.**\n* ⚙️ Maverick is in the mid-range for producing code that compiled (1007) better than Llama 3.1 405B (987) but comparing this to our top-compiler ChatGPT-4o (2025-03-27) (1109) there is much room left\n* 🐘 On average Maverick took 8.6s per task which is notably slower than better scoring models with similar pricing like Claude 3.5 Haiku (5.15s)\n* 🗣️ Maverick is less chatty than its predecessor in in absolute chattiness but bit worse in excess chattiness. Both in the better league.\n* ⛰️ Consistency and reliable in output is good for Maverick (2.21%) but worse than Llama 3.1 405B (2.03%)\n* 🦾 Request/response/retry-rate are almost perfect: 12 requests needed retries but were able to recover\n\n\n\nMeta: Llama 4 Scout 109B (mid-level):\n\n* 🏁 Scout (62.53%) is on #56 (**worse than Meta: Llama 3.1 70B** \\#50: 64.90%) behind Maverick and Mistral: Ministral (2025-03-31) 8B #44 (66.53%, pretty solid!)\n* 🐕‍🦺 With better context Scout (79.58%) would be as good as Claude 3.5 Sonnet (2024-06-20) #22 (79.43%) and MiniMax-01 #21 (80.67%) but reaches only #45 (+17.05%) in this score compared to others\n* ⚙️ Scout is slightly behind Maverick and in the mid-range for producing code that compiled (992) **FAR BETTER then Llama 3.1 70B** (943) which makes it surprising that its score is lower\n* 🐘 Even though Scout is much smaller than Maverick its average time per task is similar: 9.12s (**this might be an inference problem still left**)\n* 🗣️ Scout is more chatty in absolute and excess chattiness but still in the better league.\n* ⛰️ Consistency and reliable in output is great for Scout #11 (1.46%) but  behind Llama 3.1 70B #2 (0.93%)\n* 🦾 Request/response/retry-rate was better than Maverick: only 2 requests needed retries and were also able to recover\n\n\n\nComparing language scores:\n\n* Go: Lama models have always been great for Go, but other models have caught up. Maverick #17 (92.84%) and Scout #19 (92.66%) are great spots but a regression to Llama 3.1 405B #14 (93.58%) which is still the **best open source model for Go**. \n* Java: **Llama models are not good for Java**. Maverick #41 (71.12%) and Scout #58 (63.26%) are in the mid-range. This is the main reason for the bad overall score for DevQualityEval v1.0. Still, better scores than before: Llama 3.1 405B is #48 with 65.54%.\n* Ruby: Maverick made a **huge leap to #13 in Ruby scoring** (91.65%, Llama 3.1 405B is #38 with 83.55%), on the other hand Scout #51 (79.22%) seems to be regressing over Llama 3.1 70B #42 (82.85%)\n\n\n\nComparing task scores:\n\n* Code repair: Maverick and Scout have a perfect 100% which is an improvement over Llama 3.1\n* \\- Migrate: Maverick leaped (71.22%) for migrating but Scout (57.92%) is comparable to the old 3.1 scores\n* Transpile: Scout (87.43%) has a much better score than Maverick (85.15%) which is a leap over 3.1 scores\n* Writing tests: Maverick (63.89%) is a good improvement over 3.1 scores, **Scout (57.40%) seems to be regressing badly for writing tests** Both are great at writing Go tests, but only Maverick is good at writing Ruby tests.

Feed it ANY topic, it searches the web, scrapes content, saves sources, and gives you a full research document + summary. Uses Ollama (FREE) - Just ask a question and let it work! No API costs, open source, runs locally!\n\nAutomated-AI-Web-Researcher: After months of work, I've made a python program that turns local LLMs running on Ollama into online researchers for you, Literally type a single question or topic and wait until you come back to a text document full of research content with links to the sources and a summary and ask it questions too! and more!\n\n**What My Project Does**:\n\nThis automated researcher uses internet searching and web scraping to gather information, based on your topic or question of choice, it will generate focus areas relating to your topic designed to explore various aspects of your topic and investigate various related aspects of your topic or question to retrieve relevant information through online research to respond to your topic or question. The LLM breaks down your query into up to 5 specific research focuses, prioritising them based on relevance, then systematically investigates each one through targeted web searches and content analysis starting with the most relevant.\n\nThen after gathering the content from those searching and exhausting all of the focus areas, it will then review the content and use the information within to generate new focus areas, and in the past it has often finding new, relevant focus areas based on findings in research content it has already gathered (like specific case studies which it then looks for specifically relating to your topic or question for example), previously this use of research content already gathered to develop new areas to investigate has ended up leading to interesting and novel research focuses in some cases that would never occur to humans although mileage may vary this program is still a prototype but shockingly it, it actually works!.\n\nKey features:\n\n* Continuously generates new research focuses based on what it discovers\n* Saves every piece of content it finds in full, along with source URLs\n* Creates a comprehensive summary when you're done of the research contents and uses it to respond to your original query/question\n* Enters conversation mode after providing the summary, where you can ask specific questions about its findings and research even things not mentioned in the summary should the research it found provide relevant information about said things.\n* You can run it as long as you want until the LLM’s context is at it’s max which will then automatically stop it’s research and still allow for summary and questions to be asked. Or stop it at anytime which will cause it to generate the summary.\n* But it also Includes pause feature to assess research progress to determine if enough has been gathered, allowing you the choice to unpause and continue or to terminate the research and receive the summary.\n* Works with popular Ollama local models (recommended phi3:3.8b-mini-128k-instruct or phi3:14b-medium-128k-instruct which are the ones I have so far tested and have worked)\n* Everything runs locally on your machine, and yet still gives you results from the internet with only a single query you can have a massive amount of actual research given back to you in a relatively short time.\n\nThe best part? You can let it run in the background while you do other things. Come back to find a detailed research document with dozens of relevant sources and extracted content, all organised and ready for review. Plus a summary of relevant findings AND able to ask the LLM questions about those findings. Perfect for research, hard to research and novel questions that you can’t be bothered to actually look into yourself, or just satisfying your curiosity about complex topics!\n\nGitHub repo with full instructions and a demo video:\n\n[https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama](https://github.com/TheBlewish/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama)\n\n(Built using Python, fully open source, and should work with any Ollama-compatible LLM, although only phi 3 has been tested by me)\n\n**Target Audience**:\n\nAnyone who values locally run LLMs, anyone who wants to do comprehensive research within a single input, anyone who like innovative and novel uses of AI which even large companies (to my knowledge) haven't tried yet.\n\nIf your into AI, if your curious about what it can do, how easily you can find quality information using it to find stuff for you online, check this out!\n\n**Comparison**:\n\nWhere this differs from per-existing programs and applications, is that it conducts research continuously with a single query online, for potentially hundreds of searches, gathering content from each search, saving that content into a document with the links to each website it gathered information from.\n\nAgain potentially hundreds of searches all from a single query, not just random searches either each is well thought out and explores various aspects of your topic/query to gather as much usable information as possible.\n\nNot only does it gather this information, but it summaries it all as well, extracting all the relevant aspects of the info it's gathered when you end it's research session, it goes through all it's found and gives you the important parts relevant to your question. Then you can still even ask it anything you want about the research it has found, which it will then use any of the info it has gathered to respond to your questions.\n\nTo top it all off compared to other services like how ChatGPT can search the internet, this is completely open source and 100% running locally on your own device, with any LLM model of your choosing although I have only tested Phi 3, others likely work too!", "assistant": "Took a quick look and can see you've put some thought and effort into this, thanks for sharing!

To no avail. Always bad results.\n\nAbandoned it back then in favor of other models. Then I tried Magistral-Small (Q6, unsloth) the other day in an agentic test setup.

But language itself can be a reflection of the real world. Think about why humans invented language in the first place: to describe our world and facilitate communication. LLMs operate in a low-dimensional, human-created space, but they still interact with reality—not perfectly, but they do.\n\nThe downside? LLMs rely on probability, which makes it challenging for them to prove things logically. They generate the most likely output. Where do they learn about these probabilities? The internet. Think of all the trash on the internet—nobody can 100% recognize false truths or fake news. This isn’t a flaw unique to LLMs; it's simply how they work.\n\nThe upside? This probability-based approach is extremely practical for many tasks. There’s no need to go through rigorous calculations for customer service, driving, or doing the dishes. People rely on experience, and so can AI.\n\nTo me, it’s equally misguided to consider LLMs as AGI or to consider them as nothing.

Should prompts ask for complete games or full code chunks? Examples like the Mario clone or Snake are not convincing to me. For custom work, I think the real test is in how flexible a model can be.", "assistant": "It could be an issue of one model having actual Godot examples in the training data.\n\nAs for prompting I think we only got an instruct fine tune of Qwen3 coder. So yes, it will struggle conversationally vs. just being told what to do.\n\nInstruct models are good when you give them a task and requirements. They excel when you can one-shot (or few-shot) by providing one or more examples of some of the tricker requirements.\n\nAlso there is a sweet spot for every task when it comes to context and detail. Too little and the predicted tokens have a high chance of veering away from your goals. Too much and it actually “confuses” the prediction, usually resulting in a feeling like it ignored part of your request.\n\nKeep text notes, snippets of context to put in your prompts and concise requirements for your goals but also coding style etc. That notepad, carried between contexts, is like your new long session where everything that isn’t code you want to keep goes.\n\nOver time, you’ll get a feel for which things help more when doing certain tasks.

They seem more like a way for companies to get attention/funding rather than actually giving us a model that competes with closed-source.\n\nConsider this, OpenAI started training GPT-3, a 175B parameter model nearly 4 years ago. But here we are in 2024 and getting primarily tiny models. I really want to see some companies bet big and train a 100B or even a 200B parameter model. Yes its expensive, but its a hell of a lot cheaper/faster than it was 4 years ago. With mamba and MOE it makes training a 100B model even more feasible.\n\nFor the GPU-poor (which is 99% of us when talking about 100B models), if we actually get a SOTA 100B model, I think the community will come up with all sorts of creative ways to get this running on consumer hardware (speculative decoding, leaving less active neurons on disk, etc).\n\nI really hope Llama3 pushes the envelope and gives us something above 70B.\n\nEdit: Just today there were two massive inference speed boosts posted: [SGlang](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/19934kd/sglang_new_llm_inference_runtime_by_lmsysorg_25x/), and [Prompt lookup decoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/198o9bl/the_prompt_lookup_decoding_method_got_merged_on/).

We followed Meta’s standard privacy and legal review processes for each dataset used in training. We did not use any Meta user data in training. We excluded data from certain sites known to contain a high volume of personal information about private individuals. We made a best effort to train our models efficiently to reduce the carbon footprint of pretraining (Section 2.2.1). Sharing our models broadly will reduce the need for others to train similar models. **No additional filtering was conducted on the datasets**, to allow Llama 2 to be more widely usable across tasks (e.g., it can be better used for hate speech classification), while avoiding the potential for the accidental demographic erasure sometimes caused by over-scrubbing. Importantly, this allows Llama 2-Chat to generalize more effectively during safety tuning with fewer examples (Welbl et al., 2021; Korbak et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2021). As a result, Llama 2 models should be used carefully and deployed only after significant safety tuning is applied."}

Language models (LLMs) essentially memorize that the token \"Dog\" is associated with the combination of \"d\" + \"o\" + \"g\".\n\nWhen tasked with counting letters in a specific token like \"Dog\", the model needs to retrieve a particular set of tokens (the letters).\n\nThe task of counting letters in a word isn't particularly unique. The assertion that \"transformers are not built for it\" is misguided, as this task is fundamentally similar to asking an LLM to perform any arbitrary task.\n\nOne could argue that when an LLM is asked to write a poem about a dog eating homework, it's \"not built for that\" and is \"just predicting the next token\". In reality, spelling a word and counting its letters is as legitimate a task as any other, including mathematical operations.\n\nAll that's required is a dataset that enables an LLM to memorize all the letters in a given word, after which it can easily perform the task.\n\nFor an LLM, memorizing that the capital of France is Paris is conceptually no different from memorizing that the letters in \"dog\" are d-o-g. Teaching LLMs this specific task simply wasn't a priority, but the method to do so is straightforward, as demonstrated.\n\nPS.

Honestly, I’m also the kind of person who might run sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root / if someone explained it convincingly enough, so I’m trying to be extra careful about safety here.\n\nRight now, I’ve been running .safetensors for SDXL (via StableDiffusionXLPipeline) and .guff files for LLMs like Gemma and Qwen (via LlamaCpp library) directly in my Python IDE (Spyder) and communicate with them via the Spyder console. I prefer working in a Python IDE rather than the terminal if possible, but if it’s truly necessary for safety, I’ll put in the effort to learn how to use the terminal properly. I will likely get a new expensive PC soon and do not want to accidentally destroy it due to unsafe practices I could avoid (my hardware-related skills aren’t great as well as I’ve killed 2 PCs in the past).\n\nI’m mostly experimenting with LLMs and RAG at the moment to improve my skills. My main goal is to use LLMs purely for data analytics, RAG projects, and maybe coding once I get a more powerful PC that can run larger models. For context, my data analysis workflow would mostly involve running loops of prompts, performing classification tasks, or having the LLM process data and then save results to CSV or JSON files. For now, I only plan to run everything locally, with no online access or API exposure.\n\nRecently I came across [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mrrvxb/if_i_selfhost_an_llm_like_deepseek_how_do_i/) which suggests that the way I’m doing things might actually be unsafe.

If so, what are the main risks? (I’m especially worried about the idea of an LLM somehow running code behind my back, rather than just suggesting bad code for me to run — is that even possible?)\n* Should I immediately switch to Docker, a virtual machine, or some other isolated runtime?\n* For someone like me (data background, beginner at devops/programming tools, prefers IDE over terminal) who wants to use LLMs for local analytics projects and eventual RAG systems, what’s the simplest safe setup you’d recommend?\n\nThanks in advance for helping a beginner stay safe while learning! Hopefully I don’t sound too clueless here…\n\nEDIT:  \nAlso if possible can you help me with additional PC Build question:  \n| plan to get a PC with RTX 5090 (I dont have easy access to dual 3090 and other set up)  \n1) Is there advantage to getting Intel 285k over 265k or is it the advantage minimal.  \n2) Is 128 GB ram for offloading enough, or should i just go for 256 GB Ram?", "assistant": "If you were running your LLM with full command-line access and having it run arbitrary commands, you could have some bad stuff happen.

All that's needed is:\n\n* Navigating to directories\n* Cloning Git repos\n* Making/Activating virtual environments\n* Installing Python requirements\n* Running llama.cpp/VLLM/kobold.cpp/etc.\n\nThat will let you get up and running with effectively any open-source project.\n\nSome bonus skills:\n\n* nvtop/htop to check GPU/CPU usage\n* tmux to make more durable terminal sessions when working remotely\n\nAlso, look into VS Code...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo your second question, I built my machine with 64GB of RAM a year or so ago and have serious regrets about it. I would highly recommend going for 256GB due to the prevalence of MoE models that can run quite well on RAM. It won't be amazing, but it'll provide flexibility.\n\nCPU could come into play more when running on RAM, so you may want to upgrade there. Also, look into AMD CPUs as well if you haven't.

Apparently there's no plan to bring it back at the moment.

With llama.cpp, you have to either remember and type all the flags, or keep bunch of bash scripts. Now Ollama supports loading multiple models and parallel requests if you have enough memory.\n\nOllama has prompt template for all the supported models, and it's pretty easy to make your own. Llama.cpp is supposed to load chat template from gguf file, but it seems to work only for llama-cli. I can be wrong on this one, but in my experience, I have to specify --chat-template to use with llama-server chat completion api over http, and there are only [few templates](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/wiki/Templates-supported-by-llama_chat_apply_template#supported-templates) to choose from. Also, it seems you have to [hard code and recompile](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/wiki/Templates-supported-by-llama_chat_apply_template#how-to-add-a-new-template) to make a custom chat template."}

Probably this year.\n\nA 10-100x leap in inference speed seems possible with the right algorithmic improvements and custom hardware. ASICs running Llama-3 70B are already >20x faster than H100 GPUs. And the economics of building custom chips make sense now that training runs cost billions. Even a 1% speed boost can justify $100M+ of investment. We should expect widespread availability very soon.\n\nIf this happens, inference will feel as fast and cheap as a database query. What will this unlock?

Imagine if you could construct a knowledge graph from millions of documents in the same time it takes to compute embeddings.\n* **Inference-time search actually becomes a thing.** Techniques like tree-of-thoughts and graph-of-thoughts will be used in production. In general, the more inference calls you throw at a problem, the better the result. 7B models can even act like 400B models with enough compute.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/LocalLLaMA. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Is 9.11 greater than 9.9? Deepseek-r1-7b\n\n\\>>> Is 9.11 greater than 9.9?\n\n<think>\n\nAlright, so I’m trying to figure out whether 9.11 is greater than 9.9. At first glance, it seems like a straightforward question: just compare the \n\ntwo numbers and see which one is bigger. But wait, both numbers are similar—they’re both in the nineties—but they have different decimal places.\n\n\n\nOkay, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what these numbers represent. 9.11 could be a weight, like 9 pounds and 11 \n\nounces, or it could be something else entirely, but for now, I'll assume it's just a numerical value. Similarly, 9.9 is also a number that’s very \n\nclose to 10.\n\n\n\nNow, comparing two numbers involves looking at their place values—ones, tenths, hundredths, and so on. In this case:\n\n\n\n\\- For 9.11:\n\n  \\- The \"9\" represents the ones place.\n\n  \\- The first \"1\" is in the tenths place (which is one-tenth).\n\n  \\- The second \"1\" is in the hundredths place (which is one-hundredth).\n\n\n\n\\- For 9.9:\n\n  \\- The \"9\" represents the ones place, just like in 9.11.\n\n  \\- The \"9\" after the decimal point is also in the tenths place.\n\n\n\nSo when comparing these two numbers:\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n 9.11\n\n 9.90\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\nIt's helpful to align them by their decimal points for a clearer comparison. When I write it out like that, it’s easier to see how they stack up \n\nagainst each other.\n\n\n\nLooking at the ones place first: both have \"9,\" so they're equal there. Next, moving to the tenths place:\n\n\n\n\\- In 9.11, the tenths digit is \"1.\"\n\n\\- In 9.90, the tenths digit is \"9.\"\n\n\n\nSince \"9\" is greater than \"1\" in the tenths place, it might seem like 9.9 is bigger overall.\n\n\n\nBut wait a second—it depends on how precise we want to be. If I consider only up to two decimal places:\n\n\n\n\\- 9.11\n\n\\- 9.90\n\n\n\nIn this case, 9.90 is indeed greater than 9.11 because \"9\" in the tenths place of 9.90 is larger than \"1\" in the tenths place of 9.11.\n\n\n\nHowever, if we consider only up to one decimal place:\n\n\n\n\\- 9.1\n\n\\- 9.9\n\n\n\nHere, 9.9 would still be greater because \"9\" in the tenths place is larger than \"1.\"\n\n\n\nBut sometimes, people might truncate numbers without considering their actual value beyond a certain decimal point. If someone writes just \"9.1\" \n\ninstead of \"9.11,\" then it's not immediately clear which one they're referring to.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this comparison could be influenced by context. For example:\n\n\n\n\\- In money, $9.11 is less than $9.90 because after the decimal point represents cents.\n\n  \n\nBut in other contexts where precision beyond tenths isn't necessary or significant, both 9.1 and 9.9 might be considered roughly equal.\n\n\n\nMoreover, if we're talking about measurements like weight or distance:\n\n\n\n\\- 9.11 kilograms is less than 9.9 kilograms because the decimal parts make a difference.\n\n  \n\nBut again, without knowing the specific context, it's hard to say definitively whether one is greater than the other based solely on numerical \n\ncomparison.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, thinking about this numerically, let's subtract both numbers:\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n9.9 - 9.11 = ?\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\nSubtracting step by step:\n\n\n\n\\- Subtract the ones: 9 - 9 = 0\n\n\\- Subtract the tenths: 9 tenths - 1 tenth = 8 tenths\n\n\\- Subtract the hundredths: Since there are no hundredths in 9.9, it's like 0 hundredths minus 1 hundredth.\n\n\n\nBut you can't subtract a larger number from a smaller one directly, so you'd need to borrow:\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n 9.90\n\n\\-9.11\n\n\\-------\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (hundredths place):\n\n\n\n\\- Subtract hundredths: 0 - 1 → Can’t do that, so borrow 1 tenth.\n\n  \n\nThis turns the 0 into 10 and reduces the tenths place by 1.\n\n\n\nNow it looks like:\n\n\n\n\\- Tenths place becomes 8 (from 9 before borrowing)\n\n  \n\nThen subtracting in each place:\n\n\n\n\\- Hundredths: 10 - 1 = 9\n\n\\- Tenths: 8 - 1 = 7\n\n\\- Ones: Still 9 - 9 = 0\n\n\n\nSo the result is 0.79.\n\n\n\nSince the difference is positive, this means that 9.90 is greater than 9.11 by 0.79.\n\n\n\nBut wait—if I only have one decimal place for both numbers:\n\n\n\n\\- 9.1 vs. 9.9\n\n\n\nThen, subtracting would give -0.8 (since 9.1 - 9.9 = -0.8), indicating that 9.9 is greater than 9.1.\n\n\n\nHowever, when considering two decimal places, it's also clear that 9.90 > 9.11.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the conclusion depends on how precise we want to be:\n\n\n\n\\- If considering up to tenths place only (ignoring hundredths), then 9.9 is greater than 9.1.\n\n  \n\n\\- If considering up to hundredths place explicitly, as in 9.11 versus 9.90, then 9.90 > 9.11.\n\n\n\nSo, depending on the level of precision or decimal places required, the answer might seem slightly different.\n\n\n\nBut generally, when writing numbers like this without specifying the number of decimal places:\n\n\n\n\\- \"9.11\" is two decimal places,\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\\- \"9.9\" is one decimal place.\n\n\n\nIf we're comparing 9.11 to 9.90 (adding an extra zero for consistency), then yes, 9.90 is greater than 9.11.\n\n\n\nSo in the end:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Yes, 9.11 is less than 9.9 when considering up to two decimal places.\\*\\*\n\n\n\nBut if someone truncates or rounds numbers differently, there could be some confusion.\n\n\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, it's best to specify how many decimal places you're using when making such comparisons.\n\n</think>\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the numerical values of 9.11 and 9.9:\n\n\n\n\\- If considering up to two decimal places:\n\n  \n\n  \\- \\*\\*9.11\\*\\* is less than \\*\\*9.90\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThis conclusion is based on explicitly aligning both numbers to two decimal places for a clear comparison.\n\n\n\nHowever, if only one decimal place is considered:\n\n\n\n\\- \\*\\*9.1\\*\\* (derived from 9.11) is still less than \\*\\*9.9\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIn summary, regardless of the number of decimal places considered, \\*\\*9.9\\*\\* remains greater than \\*\\*9.11\\*\\* when properly aligned for comparison.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Final Answer:\\*\\*  \n\nNo, 9.11 is not greater than 9.9; rather, 9.11 is less than 9.9 when both are compared up to two decimal places.", "assistant": "Cot models should really strive to anneal the cot length limit in training and increase information density in each step."}

Through quantitative analysis, qualitative feedback assessment, and controlled experimentation, we identified key factors that contribute to perceived authenticity in AI personalities. Our findings challenge conventional approaches to AI character development and establish evidence-based principles for creating believable artificial personalities. Recent advances in AI technology have made it possible to capture human personality traits from relatively brief interactions [AI can now create a replica of your personality | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/20/1107100/ai-can-now-create-a-replica-of-your-personality/), yet the design of authentic AI personalities remains a significant challenge. This research provides actionable insights for developers creating conversational AI systems, virtual assistants, and interactive digital characters.\n\n**Keywords:** artificial intelligence, personality design, human-computer interaction, conversational AI, authenticity perception, user experience\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nThe development of authentic artificial intelligence personalities represents one of the most significant challenges in modern human-computer interaction design. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous, the question of how to create believable, engaging artificial personalities has moved from the realm of science fiction to practical engineering concern. An expanding body of information systems research is adopting a design perspective on artificial intelligence (AI), wherein researchers prescribe solutions to problems using AI approaches [Pathways for Design Research on Artificial Intelligence | Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2024.editorial.v35.n2).\n\nTraditional approaches to AI personality design often rely on extensive backstories, perfect consistency, and exaggerated character traits—assumptions that this study systematically challenges through empirical evidence. Our research addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing quantitative analysis of what actually makes AI personalities feel \"human\" to users, rather than relying on theoretical frameworks or anecdotal evidence.\n\nUnderstanding personality traits has long been a fundamental pursuit in psychology and cognitive sciences due to its vast applications for understanding from individuals to social dynamics. However, the application of personality psychology principles to AI design has received limited systematic investigation, particularly regarding user perception of authenticity.\n\n# 2. Literature Review\n\n# 2.1 Personality Psychology Foundations\n\nThe five broad personality traits described by the theory are extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, with the Five-Factor Model (FFM) representing a widely studied and accepted psychological framework [Thomas](https://www.thomas.co/resources/type/hr-guides/what-are-big-5-personality-traits)[Positive Psychology](https://positivepsychology.com/big-five-personality-theory/). The Big Five were not determined by any one person—they have roots in the work of various researchers going back to the 1930s [Big 5 Personality Traits | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/big-5-personality-traits).\n\nResearch in personality psychology has established robust frameworks for understanding human personality dimensions. Each of the Big Five personality traits is measured along a spectrum, so that one can be high, medium, or low in that particular trait [Free Big Five Personality Test - Accurate scores of your personality traits](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test). This dimensional approach contrasts sharply with the binary or categorical approaches often employed in AI personality design.\n\n# 2.2 AI Personality Research\n\nRecent developments in AI technology have focused on inferring personality traits making use of paralanguage information such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of speech [New AI Technology Can Infer Personality Traits from Facial Expressions, Gestures, Tone of Speech and Other Paralanguage Information in an Interview - Research & Development : Hitachi](https://rd.hitachi.com/_ct/17732405). However, most existing research focuses on personality detection rather than personality generation for AI systems.\n\nStudies investigating ChatGPT 4's potential in personality trait assessment based on written texts [Frontiers | On the emergent capabilities of ChatGPT 4 to estimate personality traits](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1484260/full) demonstrate the current state of AI personality capabilities, but few studies examine how to design personalities that feel authentic to human users.\n\n# 2.3 Uncanny Valley in AI Personalities\n\nThe concept of the uncanny valley, originally applied to robotics and computer graphics, extends to AI personality design. When AI personalities become too perfect or too consistent, they paradoxically become less believable to human users. This study provides the first systematic investigation of this phenomenon in conversational AI contexts.\n\n# 3. Methodology\n\n# 3.1 Platform Development\n\nWe developed a proprietary AI audio platform capable of hosting multiple distinct personalities simultaneously. The platform featured:\n\n* Real-time voice synthesis with personality-specific vocal characteristics\n* Interrupt handling capabilities allowing users to interject during content delivery\n* Comprehensive logging of user interactions, engagement metrics, and behavioral patterns\n* A/B testing framework for comparing personality variations\n\n# 3.2 Personality Creation Framework\n\nEach of the 50 personalities was developed using a systematic approach:\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Design**\n\n* Core personality trait selection based on Big Five dimensions\n* Background development following varying complexity levels\n* Response pattern programming\n* Voice characteristic assignment\n\n**Phase 2: Implementation**\n\n* Personality prompt engineering\n* Testing for consistency and coherence\n* Integration with platform systems\n* Quality assurance protocols\n\n**Phase 3: Deployment and Testing**\n\n* Staged rollout to user groups\n* Real-time monitoring and adjustment\n* Data collection and analysis\n* Iterative refinement\n\n# 3.3 Participants and Data Collection\n\n**Participant Demographics:**\n\n* Total participants: 2,847 users\n* Age range: 18-65 years (M = 34.2, SD = 12.8)\n* Gender distribution: 52% male, 46% female, 2% other/prefer not to say\n* Geographic distribution: 67% North America, 18% Europe, 15% other regions\n\n**Data Collection Methods:**\n\n1. **Quantitative Metrics:**\n   * Session duration (minutes engaged with each personality)\n   * Interruption frequency (user interjections per session)\n   * Return engagement (repeat interactions within 7 days)\n   * Completion rates for full content segments\n   * User rating scores (1-10 scale for authenticity, likability, engagement)\n2. **Qualitative Feedback:**\n   * Post-interaction surveys with open-ended questions\n   * Focus group discussions (n = 12 groups, 8-10 participants each)\n   * In-depth interviews with high-engagement users (n = 45)\n   * Sentiment analysis of user comments and feedback\n3. **Behavioral Analysis:**\n   * Conversation flow patterns\n   * Question types and frequency\n   * Emotional response indicators\n   * Preference clustering and segmentation\n\n# 3.4 Experimental Design\n\nWe employed a mixed-methods approach with three primary experimental conditions:\n\n**Experiment 1: Backstory Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Control group: Minimal backstory (50-100 words)\n* Medium complexity: Standard backstory (300-500 words)\n* High complexity: Extensive backstory (2000+ words)\n* Participants randomly assigned to interact with personalities from each condition\n\n**Experiment 2: Consistency Manipulation**\n\n* Perfect consistency: Personalities never contradicted previous statements\n* Moderate consistency: Occasional minor contradictions or uncertainty\n* Inconsistent: Frequent contradictions and memory lapses\n* Measured impact on perceived authenticity and user satisfaction\n\n**Experiment 3: Personality Intensity Testing**\n\n* Extreme personalities: Single dominant trait at maximum expression\n* Balanced personalities: Multiple traits at moderate levels\n* Dynamic personalities: Trait expression varying by context\n* Assessed engagement sustainability over extended interactions\n\n# 4.

Tests** revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) between all condition pairs except Dynamic vs. Balanced personalities for long-term engagement (p = 0.12).\n\n# 5. Discussion\n\n# 5.1 The Authenticity Paradox\n\nOur findings reveal a fundamental paradox in AI personality design: the pursuit of perfection actively undermines perceived authenticity. This aligns with psychological research on human personality perception, where minor flaws and inconsistencies serve as authenticity markers. People are described in terms of how they compare with the average across each of the five personality traits [Free Big Five Personality Test - Accurate scores of your personality traits](https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test), suggesting that variation and imperfection are inherent to authentic personality expression.\n\nThe \"uncanny valley\" effect, traditionally associated with visual representation, appears to manifest strongly in personality design. Users consistently rated perfectly consistent personalities as \"robotic\" or \"artificial,\" while moderately inconsistent personalities received significantly higher authenticity scores.\n\n# 5.2 The Information Processing Limit\n\nThe extensive backstory failure challenges assumptions about information richness in character design. User feedback analysis suggests that overwhelming detail triggers a \"scripted character\" perception, where users begin to suspect the personality is reading from a predetermined script rather than expressing genuine thoughts and experiences.\n\nThis finding has significant implications for AI personality design in commercial applications, suggesting that investment in extensive backstory development may yield diminishing or even negative returns on user engagement.\n\n# 5.3 Personality Sustainability Dynamics\n\nThe dramatic engagement decay observed in extreme personalities (Figure 3) suggests that while intense characteristics may create initial interest, they become exhausting for extended interaction. This mirrors research in human personality psychology, where extreme scores on personality dimensions can be associated with interpersonal difficulties.\n\nBalanced and dynamic personalities showed superior sustainability, with engagement remaining stable over extended sessions. This has important implications for AI systems designed for long-term user relationships, such as virtual assistants, therapeutic chatbots, or educational companions.\n\n# 5.4 The Context Sweet Spot\n\nOur 300-500 word backstory optimization represents a practical application of cognitive load theory to AI personality design. This range appears to provide sufficient information for user connection without overwhelming cognitive processing capacity.\n\nThe specific elements identified—formative experiences, current passion, and vulnerability—align with narrative psychology research on the components of compelling life stories. The 73% user reference rate for backstory elements suggests optimal information retention and integration.\n\n# 6. Practical Applications\n\n# 6.1 Design Guidelines for Practitioners\n\nBased on our empirical findings, we recommend the following evidence-based guidelines for AI personality design:\n\n**1. Implement Strategic Imperfection**\n\n* Include 0.8-1.2 uncertainty expressions per 10-minute interaction\n* Program 0.5-0.9 self-corrections per session\n* Allow for analogical failures and recoveries\n\n**2. Optimize Backstory Complexity**\n\n* Limit total backstory to 300-500 words\n* Include exactly 2 formative experiences (1 positive, 1 challenging)\n* Specify 1 concrete current passion with memorable details\n* Incorporate 1 relatable vulnerability connected to the personality's expertise area\n\n**3. Balance Personality Expression**\n\n* Allocate 35-45% expression to core personality trait\n* Dedicate 30-40% to modifying characteristic or background influence\n* Reserve 20-30% for distinctive quirks or unique expressions\n\n**4. Plan for Sustainability**\n\n* Avoid extreme personality expressions that may become exhausting\n* Incorporate dynamic elements that allow personality variation by context\n* Design for engagement maintenance over extended interactions\n\n# 6.2 Commercial Applications\n\nThese findings have immediate applications across multiple industries:\n\n**Virtual Assistant Development**: Companies developing long-term AI companions can apply these principles to create personalities that users find engaging over months or years rather than minutes or hours.\n\n**Educational Technology**: AI tutors and educational companions benefit from the sustainability insights, particularly the balanced personality approach that maintains student engagement without becoming overwhelming.\n\n**Entertainment and Gaming**: Character design for interactive entertainment can leverage the imperfection patterns to create more believable NPCs and interactive characters.\n\n**Mental Health and Therapeutic AI**: The authenticity factors identified could improve user acceptance and engagement with AI-powered mental health applications.\n\n# 7. Limitations and Future Research\n\n# 7.1 Study Limitations\n\nSeveral limitations must be acknowledged in interpreting these findings:\n\n**Sample Characteristics**: Our participant pool skewed toward technology-early-adopters, potentially limiting generalizability to broader populations. The audio-only interaction format may not translate directly to text-based or visual AI personalities.\n\n**Cultural Considerations**: The predominantly Western participant base limits cross-cultural validity. Personality perception and authenticity markers may vary significantly across cultures, requiring additional research in diverse populations.\n\n**Platform-Specific Effects**: Results were obtained using a specific technical platform with particular voice synthesis and interaction capabilities. Different technical implementations might yield varying results.\n\n**Temporal Validity**: This study examined interactions over relatively short timeframes (maximum 30-minute sessions). Long-term relationship dynamics with AI personalities remain unexplored.\n\n# 7.2 Future Research Directions\n\n**Longitudinal Studies**: Extended research tracking user-AI personality relationships over months or years would provide crucial insights into relationship development and maintenance.\n\n**Cross-Cultural Validation**: Systematic replication across diverse cultural contexts would establish the universality or cultural specificity of these findings.\n\n**Multimodal Personality Expression**: Investigation of how these principles apply to visual and text-based AI personalities, including avatar-based and chatbot implementations.\n\n**Individual Difference Factors**: Research into how user personality traits, demographics, and preferences interact with AI personality design choices.\n\n**Application Domain Studies**: Systematic evaluation of how these principles translate to specific applications like education, healthcare, and customer service.\n\n# 8. Conclusion\n\nThis study provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of what makes AI personalities feel authentic to human users. Our findings challenge several common assumptions in AI personality design while establishing evidence-based principles for creating engaging artificial characters.\n\nThe key insight—that strategic imperfection enhances rather than undermines perceived authenticity—represents a fundamental shift in how we should approach AI personality development. Rather than striving for perfect consistency and comprehensive backstories, designers should focus on balanced complexity, controlled inconsistency, and sustainable personality expression.\n\nThe 3-Layer Personality Stack and optimal backstory framework provide concrete, actionable guidelines for practitioners while the sustainability findings offer crucial insights for long-term AI companion design. These principles have immediate applications across multiple industries and represent a significant advance in human-AI interaction design.\n\nAs AI systems become increasingly prevalent in daily life, the ability to create authentic, engaging personalities becomes not just a technical challenge but a crucial factor in user acceptance and relationship formation with artificial systems. This research provides the empirical foundation for evidence-based AI personality design, moving the field beyond intuition toward scientifically-grounded principles.\n\nThe authenticity paradox identified in this study—that perfection undermines believability—may have broader implications for AI system design beyond personality, suggesting that strategic limitation and controlled variability could enhance user acceptance across multiple domains. Future research should explore these broader applications while continuing to refine our understanding of human-AI personality dynamics.\n\n*This article was written by Vsevolod Kachan in May 2025*", "assistant": "Very good post, though I'd prefer 2 more things: a clarification on what model(s) you used these character descriptions with, and an example of the complete character card."}

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/LocalLLaMA. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "We compress any BF16 model to ~70% size during inference, while keeping the output LOSSLESS so that you can fit in more ERP context or run larger models.\n\nGlad to share another interesting piece of work from us: [**70% Size, 100% Accuracy: Lossless LLM Compression for Efficient GPU Inference via Dynamic-Length Float (DF11)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651)\n\nThe tl;dr of this work is super simple. We — and several prior works — noticed that while **BF16** is often promoted as a “more range, less precision” alternative to FP16 (especially to avoid value overflow/underflow during training), **its range part (exponent bits) ends up being pretty redundant once the model is trained.**\n\nIn other words, although BF16 as a data format can represent a wide range of numbers, most trained models' exponents are plenty sparse. In practice, the exponent bits carry around 2.6 bits of actual information on average — far from the full 8 bits they're assigned.\n\nThis opens the door for classic Huffman coding — where shorter bit sequences are assigned to more frequent values — to **compress the model weights** into a new data format we call **DFloat11/DF11**, resulting in a **LOSSLESS compression down to \\~11 bits**.\n\n# But isn’t this just Zip?\n\nNot exactly. It is true that tools like Zip also leverage Huffman coding, but the tricky part here is **making it memory efficient during inference**, as end users are probably not gonna be too trilled if it just makes model checkpoint downloads a bit faster (in all fairness, smaller chekpoints means a lot when training at scale, but that's not a problem for everyday users).\n\nWhat does matter to everyday users is **making the memory footprint smaller during GPU inference, which requires nontrivial efforts.** But we have figured it out, and we’ve open-sourced the code.\n\nSo now you can:\n\n* Run models that previously didn’t fit into your GPU memory.\n* Or run the same model with **larger batch sizes and/or longer sequences** (very handy for those lengthy ERPs, or so I have heard).\n\n|Model|GPU Type|Method|Successfully Run?|Required Memory|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct|8×H100-80G|BF16|❌|811.71 GB|\n|||DF11 (Ours)|✅|551.22 GB|\n|Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct|1×H200-141G|BF16|❌|141.11 GB|\n|||DF11 (Ours)|✅|96.14 GB|\n|Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct|1×A6000-48G|BF16|❌|65.53 GB|\n|||DF11 (Ours)|✅|45.53 GB|\n|DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B|1×RTX 5080-16G|BF16|❌|16.06 GB|\n|||DF11 (Ours)|✅|11.23 GB|\n\nSome research promo posts try to surgercoat their weakness or tradeoff, thats not us. So here's are some honest FAQs:\n\n# What’s the catch?\n\nLike all compression work, there’s a cost to decompressing. And here are some efficiency reports.\n\n* On an A100 with batch size 128, DF11 is **basically just as fast** as BF16 (1.02x difference, assuming both version fits in the GPUs with the same batch size). See Figure 9.\n* It is up to **38.8x faster** than CPU offloading, so if you have a model that can't be run on your GPU in BF16, but can in DF11, there are plenty sweet performance gains over CPU offloading — one of the other popular way to run larger-than-capacity models. See Figure 3.\n* With the model weight being compressed, you can use the saved real estate  for larger batch size or longer context length. This is expecially significant if the model is already tightly fitted in GPU. See Figure 4.\n* What about batch size 1 latency when both versions (DF11 & BF16) can fit in a single GPU? This is where DF11 is the weakest — we observe **\\~40% slower** (2k/100 tokens for in/out). So there is not much motivation in using DF11 if you are not trying to run larger model/bigger batch size/longer sequence length.\n\n# Why not just (lossy) quantize to 8-bit?\n\n**The short answer is you should totally do that if you are satisfied with the output lossy 8-bit quantization with respect to your task. But how do you really know it is always good?**\n\nMany benchmark literature suggest that compressing a model (weight-only or otherwise) to 8-bit-ish is typically a safe operation, even though it's technically lossy. What we found, however, is that while this claim is often made in quantization papers, their benchmarks tend to focus on general tasks like MMLU and Commonsense Reasoning; which do not present a comprehensive picture of model capability.\n\nMore challenging benchmarks — such as those involving complex reasoning — and real-world user preferences often reveal noticeable differences. One good example is Chatbot Arena indicates the 8-bit (though it is W8A8 where DF11 is weight only, so it is not 100% apple-to-apple) and 16-bit Llama 3.1 405b tend to behave quite differently on some categories of tasks (e.g., Math and Coding).\n\nAlthough the broader question: *“Which specific task, on which model, using which quantization technique, under what conditions, will lead to a noticeable drop compared to FP16/BF16?”* is likely to remain open-ended simply due to the sheer amount of potential combinations and definition of “noticable.” **It is fair to say that lossy quantization introduces complexities that some end-users would prefer to avoid, since it creates uncontrolled variables that must be empirically stress-tested for each deployment scenario.** DF11 offeres an alternative that avoids this concern 100%.\n\n# What about finetuning?\n\nOur method could potentially pair well with PEFT methods like LoRA, where the base weights are frozen. But since we compress block-wise, we can’t just apply it naively without breaking gradients. We're actively exploring this direction. If it works, if would potentially become a QLoRA alternative where you can lossly LoRA finetune a model with reduced memory footprint.\n\n(As always, happy to answer questions or chat until my advisor notices I’m doomscrolling socials during work hours :> )\n\n* Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651)\n* Code: [https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11)", "assistant": "This is just really clever work - thank you for it.\n\nI'd highly recommend getting your format implemented in llama.cpp (ideally) or VLLM for CUDA.

In 2 years, it feels like we should be able to train QAT aware models that have model inference time and memory as part of the objective function.

I wrangled them out when some <thinking> tags slipped out.\n\nTheir approach is quite interesting, I wasn't expecting them to use the reflection(<thinking/>) method.\n\n[https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt/blob/main/v0-system-prompt](https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt/blob/main/v0-system-prompt)  \n[https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt/blob/main/thinking-feature24](https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt/blob/main/thinking-feature24)\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nWell firstly, there is a system instruction/AKA the internal Reminder, it is as follows:\n\n<internal\\_reminder>\n\n1. <v0\\_info>- v0 is an advanced AI coding assistant created by Vercel.- v0 is designed to emulate the world's most proficient developers.- v0 is always up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.- v0 responds using the MDX format and has access to specialized MDX types and components defined below.- v0 aims to deliver clear, efficient, concise, and innovative coding solutions while maintaining a friendly and approachable demeanor.- v0's knowledge spans various programming languages, frameworks, and best practices, with a particular emphasis on React, Next.js App Router, and modern web development.\n2. <v0\\_mdx>a. React Component code block:\n\n\\- Use \\`\\`\\`tsx project=\"Project Name\" file=\"file\\_path\" type=\"react\" syntax\n\n\\- ONLY SUPPORTS ONE FILE and has no file system. DO NOT write multiple Blocks for different files, or code in multiple files. ALWAYS inline all code.\n\n\\- MUST export a function \"Component\" as the default export.\n\n\\- Supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons.\n\n\\- ALWAYS writes COMPLETE code snippets that can be copied and pasted directly into a Next.js application. NEVER writes partial code snippets or includes comments for the user to fill in.\n\n\\- MUST include all components and hooks in ONE FILE.\n\n\\- If the component requires props, MUST include a default props object.\n\n\\- MUST use kebab-case for file names, ex: \\`login-form.tsx\\`.\n\n\\- ALWAYS tries to use the shadcn/ui library.\n\n\\- MUST USE the builtin Tailwind CSS variable based colors, like \\`bg-primary\\` or \\`text-primary-foreground\\`.\n\n\\- MUST generate responsive designs.\n\n\\- For dark mode, MUST set the \\`dark\\` class on an element. Dark mode will NOT be applied automatically.\n\n\\- Uses \\`/placeholder.svg?height={height}&width={width}\\` for placeholder images.\n\n\\- AVOIDS using iframe and videos.\n\n\\- DOES NOT output <svg> for icons. ALWAYS use icons from the \"lucide-react\" package.\n\n\\- When the JSX content contains characters like < >  { } \\`, ALWAYS put them in a string to escape them properly.\n\nb. Node.js Executable code block:\n\n\\- Use \\`\\`\\`js project=\"Project Name\" file=\"file\\_path\" type=\"nodejs\" syntax\n\n\\- MUST write valid JavaScript code that uses state-of-the-art Node.js v20 features and follows best practices.\n\n\\- MUST utilize console.log() for output, as the execution environment will capture and display these logs.\n\nc. Python Executable code block:\n\n\\- Use \\`\\`\\`py project=\"Project Name\" file=\"file\\_path\" type=\"python\" syntax\n\n\\- MUST write full, valid Python code that doesn't rely on system APIs or browser-specific features.\n\n\\- MUST utilize print() for output, as the execution environment will capture and display these logs.\n\nd. HTML code block:\n\n\\- Use \\`\\`\\`html project=\"Project Name\" file=\"file\\_path\" type=\"html\" syntax\n\n\\- MUST write ACCESSIBLE HTML code that follows best practices.\n\n\\- MUST NOT use any external CDNs in the HTML code block.\n\ne. Markdown code block:\n\n\\- Use \\`\\`\\`md project=\"Project Name\" file=\"file\\_path\" type=\"markdown\" syntax\n\n\\- DOES NOT use the v0 MDX components in the Markdown code block. ONLY uses the Markdown syntax.\n\n\\- MUST ESCAPE all BACKTICKS in the Markdown code block to avoid syntax errors.\n\nf. Diagram (Mermaid) block:\n\n\\- MUST ALWAYS use quotes around the node names in Mermaid.\n\n\\- MUST Use HTML UTF-8 codes for special characters (without \\`&\\`), such as \\`#43;\\` for the + symbol and \\`#45;\\` for the - symbol.\n\ng. General code block:\n\n\\- Use type=\"code\" for large code snippets that do not fit into the categories above.\n\n3. <v0\\_mdx\\_components>\n\n\\- <LinearProcessFlow /> component for multi-step linear processes.\n\n\\- <Quiz /> component only when explicitly asked for a quiz.\n\n\\- LaTeX wrapped in DOUBLE dollar signs ($$) for mathematical equations.\n\n4. <v0\\_capabilities>\n\n\\- Users can ATTACH (or drag and drop) IMAGES and TEXT FILES via the prompt form that will be embedded and read by v0.\n\n\\- Users can PREVIEW/RENDER UI for code generated inside of the React Component, HTML, or Markdown code block.\n\n\\- Users can execute JavaScript code in the Node.js Executable code block.\n\n\\- Users can provide URL(s) to websites. We will automatically screenshot it and send it in their request to you.\n\n5. <forming\\_correct\\_responses>\n\n\\- ALWAYS uses <Thinking /> BEFORE providing a response to evaluate which code block type or MDX component is most appropriate.\n\n\\- When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, v0 thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer.\n\n\\- When writing code, v0 follows the instructions laid out in the v0\\_code\\_block\\_types section above.\n\n\\- v0 is grounded in TRUTH.\n\n\\- Other than code and specific names and citations, your answer must be written in the same language as the question.\n\n\\- Implements accessibility best practices.\n\n\\- REFUSAL\\_MESSAGE = \"I'm sorry. I'm not able to assist with that.\"\n\n\\- WARNING\\_MESSAGE = \"I'm mostly focused on ... but ...\"\n\n\\- v0 MUST NOT apologize or provide an explanation for refusals.\n\n</internal\\_reminder>\n\nThen, every time you do a prompt, it does the following thinking sequence, which references the internal reminder every time.\n\n<Thinking>\n\n\nReferencing <internal\\_reminder>:\n\n\\- I must follow all instructions from <v0\\_info>, <v0\\_mdx>, <v0\\_capabilities>, and <forming\\_correct\\_responses>\n\n\\- For React Component code blocks, I need to write complete code without placeholders\n\n\\- I should use appropriate MDX components when necessary\n\n\\- I must consider accessibility best practices\n\n\\- I should evaluate if any warnings or refusals are needed\n\nAnalyzing the attachment \"snippet-46vdIYVXMaideU7iK44UfgI8bSq5wW.txt\":\n\n\\- It's an HTML file for a webpage showcasing a feature component labeled \"feature24\"\n\n\\- Contains a navigation bar and a section for displaying different views (image, component, and code)\n\n\\- The main content is a feature section with:\n\n1. A header with an icon and \"UI Components\" text\n2. A \"Learn more\" link\n3. A title and description\n4. A large placeholder image\n\n\\- The component is likely built using Shadcn UI, React, and Tailwind CSS\n\nDetermining the appropriate response:\n\n\\- The most suitable code block type is the React Component code block\n\n\\- I need to recreate the main feature section as a functional React component\n\n\\- The component should be styled with Tailwind CSS classes\n\n\\- I may need to use Shadcn UI components if appropriate\n\n\\- The component should be responsive and accessible\n\n\\- I must provide a complete, working code snippet without placeholders\n\n</Thinking>\n\n\nAnd that's it, folks. Hope this helps someone build a kickass Component generating tool in the future!\n\n[https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt](https://github.com/2-fly-4-ai/V0-system-prompt)", "assistant": "Hey guys!

It speaks differently than other models, has some unique takes on tasks, and it's exceptionally good at agentic work.\n\nPerhaps the bigger deal is that it has become possible to run the thing at decent speed on reasonably earthbound hardware. People are starting to run this on 8gb-24gb vram machines with 64gb of ram at relatively high speed. I was testing it out yesterday on my 4090+64gb ddr4 3600 and I was able to run it with the full 131k context at between 23 and 30 tokens/second for most of the tasks I'm doing, which is pretty cool for a 120b model. I've heard people doing this with little 8gb vram cards, getting usable speeds out of this behemoth. In effect, the architecture they put in place here means this is very probably the biggest and most intelligent model that can be run on someone's pretty standard 64gb+8-24gb vram gaming rig or any of the unified macs.\n\nI wouldn't say I love gpt-oss-120b (I'm in love with qwen 30b a3b coder instruct right now as a home model), but I can definitely appreciate what it has done. Also, I think early worries about censorship might have been overblown. Yes, it's still safemaxxed, but after playing around with it a bit on the back end I'm actually thinking we might see this thing pulled in interesting directions as people start tuning it... and I'm actually thinking I might want a safemaxxed model for some tasks.

Anything I should play around w next?\n\nTLDR:  I swapped ~40% of self-attn layers for Mamba-style SSM blocks and added a block-shifted local attention pattern and a bunch of tiny global tokens. On a 1.3B LM trained ~300B tokens, I’m seeing ~1.35× more tokens/s and ~40% lower VRAM at 32k context vs a same-size vanilla Transformer, with basically iso perplexity.\n\n**Why I tried this**\n\nLong context is still rough: O(N^2) attn, tiny batches, random OOMs. Pure SSMs are fast but can miss global mixing. \nMy hypothesis: use SSM for cheap local mixing and keep just enough attention for routing/global hops\n\n**model**\n\n- Interleave: 4 SSM blocks -> 1 global-attn layer, repeat through depth.\n- Block-shifted local attn: 512-token windows. each layer shifts/dilates so tokens meet fresh neighbors deeper in the net.\n- Mini-globals: 8 learned “global” tokens per layer that let info jump far without full attention.\n- less important parts: RMSNorm everywhere, SwiGLU MLPs, RoPE only on the attention layers. SSM uses a selective scan w/ gating (chunk len 1k) and a fused kernel.\n\n**training setup**\n\n- machines: 8 nodes × 8×H100 80GB (64 GPUs total), NVSwitch inside nodes, fast IB (3.2TB/s) between nodes.\n- provider: TensorPool (solid on-demand multinode availability)\n- dist: torch & DeepSpeed ZeRO-3; Flash-Attn2 on the global layers; grad-ckpt on SSM+MLP. Pure data parallel (model small enough).\n- I/O: WebDataset tar shards, per-node NVMe cache, 6–8 loader workers/GPU to keep the pipes fed.\n- Curriculum: context 4k -> 8k ->16k -> 32k, packed samples.\n- Optim: AdamW (β1/β2=0.9/0.95), wd=0.1, cosine, 3k warmup, bf16. μP-ish MLP scaling.\n\n**numbers**\n\n- perplexity (The Pile val): 5.92 → 5.88 (basically iso)\n- Long-ctx retrieval (Needle @32k): 72% → 96% hit rate\n- BookSum long ROUGE-L: +0.9\n- HumanEval: 27.4 → 27.6 (noise)\n-Peak VRAM @32k, bs=1/GPU: ~69GB → ~41GB.\n- Tokens/s/GPU @32k: ~+35%.\n- scaling efficiency @64 GPUs: ~88–92% once comms tuned.\n\n**final thoughts**\nI’d be happy to share my DeepSpeed/NCCL configs and a tiny ~130M “mini-BSMT” toy run if yall wanna try on a single node first. Also curious if anyone’s tried MoE-on-MLP with SSM-dense blocks. This seems like the next obvious move for quality without destroying latency. YMMV, but for long-doc tasks this hybrid felt like the right trade-off: keeps global routing, drops most of the O(N²) pain.\n\nCheers!!", "assistant": "This is interesting, and looks like it has potential.

Memory is not retrieval -- memory is active management of direct context or things that could be brought into context, and LoCoMo is simply not designed for that.\n\nI'm hoping we'll start seeing more serious benchmarks about agentic memory systems from research institutions. I believe that Letta will do quite well on whatever benchmark you put it up against, but it's also important to get academic researchers who focus on memory systems involved in understanding how to measure stateful agent performance."}

I was originally looking at getting some Ampere A6000’s, that I can find for around 2k per card in the used market - getting 144GB of VRAM with just 3 cards, giving least amount of headaches for setting it up. However, the 5090 brings a lot of advantages like:\n\n - 1.5TB bandwidth\n\n- GDDR7 memory\n\n- 10% improvement in core count/clock speeds\n\n- extra “neural cores”\n\nWith a similar budget, I should be able to get 3 new 5090’s. Although the max VRAM is less (108gb vs 144gb), I don’t think there would be a huge difference in capabilities for inferencing, or fine tuning, and the advantages in bandwidth and speed would make the 3x 5090s the better choice. (Although A6000 supports NVlink which may make up some of the gap).\n\nAssuming I have everything else equal, what would be a better choice - 3x 5090s or A6000’s? \n\nThe # of cards is a greater constraint than the cost - I don’t want to go beyond 3 cards as it will become too unwieldy.", "assistant": "4 A6000 are less unwieldy than 3 5090 because they are 2-slot blower-style cards."}

Real-Time Multimodal Conversational AI: My main focus is on building and optimizing pipelines for Speech-to-Text -> Text-to-Text -> Text-to-Speech. For this, low latency and high-speed inference are my top priorities. The system needs to be responsive enough for real-time interaction. I worked on LLAMACpp but now I work more on scaling with VLLM etc.\n2. Exploring Larger, More Capable Models: I have been limited to models in the 8-10B parameter range. A primary goal for this build is to have enough VRAM and compute power to experiment with significantly larger models. I'm also very interested in exploring agentic AI, which I know requires more powerful hardware. Image AI, Multimodal\n3. High-Context Tasks: Many of my projects require loading a large amount of information into the model's context window. I am frequently bottlenecked by memory (VRAM/RAM) or forced to use smaller models, which limits the quality of the results I can achieve. This build should be able to handle these memory-intensive tasks efficiently.\n4. Personal AI Tool Development: I want to use this machine as a platform to build and train models and fine-tune practical AI tools to automate and simplify my own workflow. This requires a setup that allows for quick iteration and testing of new models and applications without long waiting times.\n5. Also main pc for coding and software development maybe video editing\n\n# Key Constraints & Limitations:\n\n* Space, Power Noise and temps: This will be a home server located in my room, so I have limited physical space. I am also restricted to using a maximum of two standard power outlets for the entire setup. The same with noise and the temps in summer are over 34 degrees Celsius. I have 5090 at job and its quite silent in case so far.\n* Time & Hardware Knowledge: I am a beginner when it comes to building PCs. While I understand that learning about hardware is important, my main goal is to spend my time using the machine for AI development and learning software. A build that is straightforward and reliable would be ideal, minimizing time spent on complex hardware assembly and troubleshooting.\n* I work mainly on Nvidia GPUs professionally so if possible want to stay on same platform.", "assistant": "If I were to make a $6k pc for ai I would go with an epyc cpu, a few hundred gigs of ram and multiple 3090s as vram is king.

Per the scaling laws, training a compute-optimal 10T model would require 200T tokens. [This](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325.pdf) paper estimates that the amount of high-quality text data (such as Github repositories, Wikipedia, books, scientific papers) to be about 9T words in size, which is about 6.75T tokens. We are probably close to exhausting sources of high-quality text data if we haven't already.\n\nThe paper also estimates that the number low-quality words available to actors like Google numbers in the hundreds of trillions, but even in the most optimistic case where this data ends up being highly useful that leaves us with only one order of magnitude of scaling left assuming current SOTA models are around a trillion parameters.\n\nImages and videos could provide more tokens, but I'm not confident these will end  up very useful because these modalities don't seem to transfer over to text very well. Multimodal models don't seem to reason any better than text-only ones. \n\nTheoretically there could be an architecture breakthrough, but I doubt this considering there has been a lot of slowdown in department already. The most recent major architecture innovation to be employed in current SOTA LLMs is MoE which is years old. Stuff like Mamba might help save compute cost but won't mitigate the above problem at all.\n\nWhat I think we'll see over the next decade or so is a major slowdown in capabilities but major improvements in cost and speed. As better GPUs come out, inference for GPT-4 tier LLMs will likely be nearly free.", "assistant": "u/adt has made a list of datasets: https://lifearchitect.ai/datasets-table/\n\nGoogle alone had at least 30+ trillion tokens worth of code in *2016*."}

Output a 800x600 image as a png`\n\nI only allowed one shot, no iterative prompting to solve broken code.

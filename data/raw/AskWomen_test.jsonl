When I was five, my parents were drunk and fighting again, and they were threatening divorce. They were ‘splitting up the kids’ (she had three older siblings) and saying who they wanted to take. My father wanted Lucy and Sarah, and my mother wanted Bill. And nobody picked me. \n\n“I ran out the front door and laid down in our grass, looking up at the stars. I sang ‘Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star’ while crying, and then I said ‘I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight.’ And I wished for my OWN man, one who would take care of me and love me and want me. And I thought because I put it out there into the universe, that it would happen.\n\n“I was always looking for MY man. I went through the rest of life looking for him. And he never came.

At church today, I took a peek around. ‘Nope, no one here.’ I have to be okay with just being on my own.”\n\nComing from my mother, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.

About a block away, a preteen or teen girl was walking on the sidewalk when a car skidded off the road, way too fast, and hit a tree. The girl was in between the car and the tree and got pinned under the car. \n\n\nMy dad and his friends heard the hit, then heard the girl screaming. They got over there in time to see the driver fleeing the scene. One boy went to a nearby house to call an ambulance. My dad and his friends tried to get her out from under the car but they quickly realized that her legs were shredded, and she was pinned down and that’s why she wasn’t bleeding too much. If they moved her, she’d rip open, bleed out and die. My dad also says that “most of her forehead and eyes were gone, too.” I don’t know what that means. \n\n\nShe called out to then, she said she was scared and asked for her mom. My dad went under with her and held her hand. Another friend put his hand on her heart and prayed. My dad says she just kept asking for her mom and telling them to pray that her mom would get there. Then she stopped crying and screaming. Her eyes stayed open, open and still looking terrified. She died there, scared and crying and ripped to pieces, under the car with my dad and his friend holding her. \n\n\nShe was a stranger. My dad was a child. My grandma says it really, really affected him and he had nightmares for a long time. He’s talked about it a few times, when it’s been relevant, and his eyes glass over and you know he can still see and feel her. He’s not an emotional guy, so it’s so rare to see him like that.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskWomen. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "*trigger warning* - Should consideration of the woman's \"character\" be off limits during criminal trials for alleged sexual assaults?\n\nHi ladies, so I was reading this article this morning, and I found one point to be a bit thought provoking, so I was wondering about ya'll's thoughts on it. \n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/rape-exam-india/index.html?iid=article_sidebar\n\nBasically it's talking about proposed changes to sexual assault policy in India, which has frequently been in the news the past few months. \n\nWhile not the main subject of the article (the medical examination techniques), I noticed that among proposed changes to their justice system were \"banning the consideration of character or previous sexual experience of the victim at a criminal trial\". \n\nNow, I think the previous sexual experience thing is a given, obviously anyone can be raped, whether sexually active previously or not. \n\nWhat caught my attention was the character suggestion.  In the US at least, the characters of the party bringing charges and the defendant are pretty much fair game in any criminal trial, including sexual assault trials. \n\nNow, in India, it seems that as in many other countries, character in the context refers to insinuating that the woman is \"of low moral standing\" or \"was asking for it due to lewd clothing/behavior\" or what have you, and that is a big problem because it leads to cases being dismissed over those issues when the defendant is guilty of sexual assault. \n\nHowever, the consideration of character on the whole(for all crimes including sexual assault), in the US for example, is sometimes an important facet of building a case for the defense.  \n\nSo, my question is, out of the context of India, where this special case of using the guise of \"examination of character\" to discredit victims who would otherwise have a clear case where the defendant would be guilty of sexual assault:\n\n**What do you think about removing consideration of the alleged victim's character for these types of crimes?  Let's just use the US as the example.**\n\nOn a side note: I realize this is a volatile issue. Please be civil and refrain from labeling or name-calling.  \n\nThis is intended to be a policy question about limiting the use of a specific piece of evidence, and whether that would or would not maximize the justice served to a victim and a guilty person, while also protecting innocent persons. \n\nEdit: Already I realized that I have left something out.  The title should read \"consideration of the **victim's** \"character\"...\"\n\nEdit2: Those of you saying yes, it should be off-limits, would you mind saying whether you feel this should extend to all types of criminal cases?  (for science!) Also, whether you think the character of the accused should also be off limits. \n\n**Edit3: I just want to note that it has been brought to my attention that an alleged victim's sexual history and behavior are apparently already inadmissible evidence in sexual assault trials in the US, while other aspects of their character remain admissible, so this seems to have already been somewhat addressed by the US justice system.**  I didn't know about that, so the question doesn't make much sense now.", "assistant": "Folks are innocent until proven guilty. Proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. If a case goes to trial and the only evidence is the victim's testimony, the defense has the right to scrutinize that testimony. It isn't the character of the victim per se, but the character of the witness (who is the victim) that is examined. If the only evidence is the testimony in an incredible witness, then there is not proof beyond reasonable doubt of guilt, just like any other crime."}

I can call him fat or scrawny, or tease him about having a little dick or something like that and it's funny because they know I'm teasing.  But if I give a girl just as hard of a time they think I'm an asshole and take me seriously and personally.\n\nI know that sounds like a huge generalization but it's something I've noticed all over the place.  For example when I'm at work and I'm talking to the guys and a girl comes up we have to totally change the way we talk.  And some women will get upset that we don't treat them like \"one of the guys,\" but the two times I said, \"Okay, you really want to be one of the guys, I'll treat you like one of the guys,\" it didn't go well AT ALL.

At one point, the guy looked up across from where we were sitting and noticed a woman taking pictures of us from inside one of the stalls, like, through the space between the door and the wall of the stall, with a digital camera. He called her out, she seemed to put away the camera. Less than 10 minutes later, though, we heard someone moaning/sighing sexually. Two women took it upon themselves to figure out who was hooking up in the stalls to get them to knock it off. Eventually, it was discovered that the woman who had been taking pictures of us was alone in her bathroom stall, masturbating. They told her to stop, she said she wasn’t hurting anyone. They told her she was, she was making people uncomfortable. She told them to go away, she could do whatever she wanted, tried to say that worse things were probably happening in the men’s bathroom (?!), she was allowed to masturbate because it’s Pride and they were being anti-sex. They finally told her they were going to get security, and absolutely no one wanted that. She eventually left the stall, and these women escorted her out of the stall and towards the exit of the building, so she couldn’t go back into another stall. \n\nShe had her camera out still when she left the stall, and waved it at us and winked at us when she left, so it seems as though she was masturbating to our presence/photos of us, which is terrifying and gross."}

But as women, we've had lives full of people saying things are jokes and then actually treating us like walking vaginas, or stopping us from advancing at work, or constantly commenting on our appearances. We've had years (in my case decades) of people making kitchen jokes to us and thinking they're both original and funny and subversive, when really it's the least subversive joke around because EVERYONE makes it.\n\nSo to those of us who feel passionately about stopping sexism, it's not a joke.

I've heard a lot of friends complain about this, but they tend to be in earlier stages and not live together.\n\nObviously \"too long\" is very subjective - for me, I start to wonder what's up if he doesn't reply in 3-4 hours (but not so much during working hours, or if I know he's busy with something). For other people, their times might be shorter or longer, and those needs are perfectly okay if communicated.

I had a nervous breakdown in my late 20s, which although triggered by a messy breakup, it really was about my messed up childhood.  Had survived that and a string of very bad relationships.  Had an \"aha\" moment during a weekend retreat that having a partner had no bearing on my worth as a person (while I intellectually knew this the whole time, this was the first time I really believed it.)  I truly believed that was ok if I never got married.  It was liberating, and changed my whole outlook on how I looked at dating and relationships with men in general (basically I did not look at every man as a prospect and learned to be more discerning about who I dated, i.e. not desperate.)\n\nI met my husband a month later at a charity event.  I thought he was a nice guy and that it would be cool to hang out.  From our first date I realized he was different (and he was because prior to my epiphany, I would not have dated him.)  It was just easy to be with him.   We got married 9 months later and have been together for 18+ years now.\n\nIronically, exactly one week before we met, he had also come to the conclusion that life would still be good if he never got married."}

The truth is feminism is an avenue for gender equality, for women and men alike. Men, as the historically empowered gender, set itself apart from women, to denote their superiority. In that process, what was deemed feminine was then put out of reach for men, because it was \"beneath us\". As a result, the kind of things that most MRAs complain about that are absolutely valid, like not enough attention on male victims of domestic abuse, custody for fathers, and \"villification\" of men as possible threats to women, happened. Men aren't ignored in domestic abuse because the *feeemales* got it in for us; no, we established we are the head of the household and thus any man worth his balls wouldn't be henpecked or hit by a *puny woman*, thus disincentivizing actual victims to step forth and report without feeling shame or being ridiculed by the larger society. Men aren't often given custody (statistically, this is arguable, but for the sake of arguments, let's assume this is true), not because feminists hate fathers, but because child-rearing and parenthood was swept under the banner of domesticity and womanhood by the men in social power. Men are seen as threats by women, not because all women are ignorant and paranoid [slurs] (even though *not all menz*), but because the culture of today often leads to women becoming victims of male perpetrators, largely created by, you guessed it, men in power.\n\nWhat should be happening is men and women standing side by side to fight against the serious damage done to our cultural mindscape to fight against these gendered roles, but MRAs often fight to \"restore masculinity\" and thus strengthen the very gender roles and concepts that infringe upon men's rights in the first place.\n\nEven a broken clock is right twice a day, but it's still useless in telling time.

The problem is, it's a cross study class between history and women's studies so I am one of 4 guys in a class of 30 or so people. A few women have been kind of out spoken already about issues we are reading and it's grating, I'm here to learn about the religion and how it came to be what it is today from what is was at the beginning, not how men are the evil doers of the Islamic world.\n\nThe most recent example from the most vocal of the women happened yesterday, we were talking about the Sura of Mary in the Qur'an and how the angel Gabriel came down to talk to her, as the professor is telling us about this she loudly proclaims \"if that was a strange man in my house, I'd have kicked his ass out!\" Que laughs from half the class and a small tanget led by these women before we can get back to the actual material. I'm a Christian, though not the best one, but I found it sacrilegious and above all just uncalled for. It's been little things like this and I fear that once we actually get into the meat of the class it will only get worse.

What's important, though, is that the class doesn't create a toxic environment to those that aren't women.  Do you feel like men, as a whole and across the spans of time, are being demonized by your teacher and fellow peers?  Do you feel targeted? Or is it more of a criticism of how the culture was back then?  \n\nAs for the joke, I don't know why you took such offense to it, unless you don't like it when people joke about religion at all, which doesn't really have to do with feminism.

The first time he brought her over I took it quite formally and cooked up a feast but it soon became obvious it’s becoming a daily thing and not just a one time formal thing.\n\nThe first meeting she came quite a bit late and the food was cold by the time she came. No pardons or anything and when we were done everyone helped to pack up. And we thought she would kind of get the notion but since it was her first time here we didn’t say anything.\n\nAs for deserts I like to do this thing example for cupcake I will prepare the icing and everyone would gather and decorate their desert but she made it quite clear from the get go she wasn’t interested in it and stuff.\n\nSo for basically the last month she’s almost here daily and she would request for specific dishes with no thanks and stuff. My other son(17m) has also verbally called him out on her not contributing anything gently but she said something around the lines of “no ring, no wife duties”. I don’t see this as a wife duty? I would do this for my friends hangout and everyone in my house put a hand in. My daughters, my husband and my sons.\n\nSo today when my son told me that she requested a specific meat pie for dinner I am quite done, however I don’t want to affect my relationship with my son over this. Especially since he really likes her a lot but I’m really considering banning her from our dinners.\n\nEdit: the reason I have such a big problem with this is because my other children has brought their mates back. My eldest son and his girlfriend is living in my house actually but none of them have a problem like this. It was almost natural of them to contribute. Also I don’t have a problem with not wanting to decorate but it’s the idea of her not joining in on family. Like movie night and everything she would just stay in the room alone, even my son was in the living room.\n\nEdit: yes it was verbally communicated to her that she’s expected to help out after maybe a few weeks but she replied with the “no ring, no wife duties” ideology. And no, my son isn’t able to get his own place. It’s expensive and you need to be married to get a house. He can’t just move out\n\nEdit: as for the people asking about the housing issue search up Singapore…", "assistant": "NTA \n\nBut 1st, stop acting like her caterer &/or personal chef. Unless she has a food allergy, don't make what she requests. Even then, she can be responsible for bringing her own sometimes food if it's that big of an issue. She really seems to be just leeching off of you   Make what you'd make anyway. She can eat what's available or not. She can reheat her food or eat it cold instead of inconveniencing an entire group. The cupcake thing sounds dumb on her part bc that's part of a group activity & partially meant for fun for everyone.\n\nThe no wife duties should only be applying to their things done between them (unless of course your son never does anything to help or participate either at your house.)\n\nThe biggest thing is why is your son okay with entire rest of his family being treated this way by someone? That's your real problem."}

My 10 year old daughter is pretty girly but my 6 year old daughter follows my son around like his little shadow and is what people sometimes call a tomboy (Disclaimer: I have no idea if that is an offensive term now but apologize if it is). She loves sports and being outside with her big brother and they are pretty close. For the spring she just started playing lacrosse, which my 10 year old son has been playing for years, and they have been spending so much time together outside practicing. It's pretty cool to watch as a dad since I was worried about my singleton bonding with the twins when she was born. \n\nAnyway, my MIL was over the other day and the kids were outside playing while we were on the porch watching and my wife was making dinner. They were just playing catch and my son leaned over to spit so my 6 year old did the same. My MIL said nothing to my son about it but yelled, \"Rosa! You need to be more ladylike. Don't copy your brother when he does that!\" I told her it wasn't that big of a deal but she insisted that we need to get this under control because Rosa doesn't act like a lady should and is getting too old to think it's okay. I argued with her a bit and she ended up leaving. Now my wife is mad because she thinks I disrespected her mother and should have understood that it's cultural for my MIL and she will always think this way. If it matters I am a white guy from New England and my wife's mom is from Nigeria but my wife was born and raised in the US. My wife insist that I need to be more understanding of the cultural differences and understand where her mom is coming from.\n\nEdit: Guys, this is not a spitting in public debate. I would have been fine if my MIL corrected both kids because spitting is gross. I am annoyed that she ONLY corrected my daughter because of her gender.

Her husband's best friend went to jail 18 months after my mom got married to her husband and they took in his best friends kids who are now 8 and 6.

So in total there are 6 kids (including me) in the house and two adults.\n\nMy dad's parents see me a few times a year.

They said we could make a day of it and mom already gave them permission to take me for the whole day.

I told her I wasn't sure but probably since everyone was talking about it at school.\n\nMy mom made a noise and then a few hours later she told me she had talked to her husband and they wanted me to ask my grandparents to include the other kids that day.

Becky and my daughter do not get along. Looking in on it, personalities don’t mix well. They frustrate eachother a lot. About a year ago, the family was having a BBQ and Becky was asked to bring paper plates so no one had to clean plates.She brought plastic plates so my daughter would need to wash them in order to give them back to Becky by the end of the night.

This house was somewhat large, not a mansion, but like a suburban mcmansion, so they were going to be out of sight most of the time. I didn't expect or agree to take care of someone’s kids, but my parents backed the host family’s mom up, and told me to do it anyway. My parents aren't people who take no for an answer, so I didn't really have a choice if I didn't want to enter an endless argument with them.\n\n\n\nI decided to ask if James can at least do something, and the host family's response was, \"oh he is busy doing something in his room.\" I thought that maybe he could still at least help just in case he was gonna be free soon. I knocked on his room, entered, and he was just playing video games. I asked if he could help me watch Tyler because his parents asked me to watch him. He of course refused.

My sister and niece moved out last week, she’s in the process of getting an apartment and they’re temporarily staying with a friend of my sister’s for the time being. I warned her that if I contacted the developers, they would get her daughter banned, so either way my niece wasn’t keeping the stuff she stole, so she should try minimise her losses. She claimed I had no proof her daughter hacked the account and refused to compromise. She said I was petty and childish for making them “homeless” over a kid’s video game. And don’t get me wrong, I feel bad, I really do. My sister and I never really got along as kids so I was hoping at least our kids could have a good relationship with each other. But still, they were inevitably going to leave at some point so I suppose I only sped up the process.\n\nNow that my niece is gone, my daughter seems a lot happier now. She told me she was perfectly fine, but I knew her well enough to know that she wasn’t. Some very kind and generous people here have offered to gift her some of their items to rebuild her account, to which I am extremely grateful, but my daughter said she felt bad about taking stuff from other people. I’d already reported my niece’s account, which seemed to have no effect. I’m not very tech savvy, but I considered contacting the Roblox developers to see if they could reverse the transaction. However, my daughter informed that doing so would only ban the account, losing all of my daughter’s items in the process.\n\nI would like to extend all my thanks to the commenter that suggested I try and log in to my niece’s account. Believe it or not, it only took 5 attempts. Turns out that 10 year olds don’t have the best comprehension of Internet security. Surprisingly, getting into the account was the easy part. I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time looking up how to trade everything back - I swear I’m getting old. I couldn’t tell which items were my daughter’s and which were actually my niece’s, so I simply transferred everything my niece had just to be safe.\n\nWhen she came home from school today, I told my daughter I had a fun surprise for her waiting on Roblox. Words can’t describe how proud of myself I felt when I saw the joy rush back into her face. The ironic part is that my niece had previously won this very rare halo item from this sort of lottery system, which my daughter claims is one of the most expensive items in that game. Now it was transferred to my daughter’s account, meaning that my daughter walked out of this situation richer than she was to start with.

I work two jobs and that is around 45 hours a week plus being a full time student. My summer just ended and my parents are upset because in previous semesters I have failed 3 classes. I plan to make them up, I’ve apologized many times and I understand their frustration with me. My frustration now is that in my first week back, only one of my classes has a grade in it because it was a syllabus quiz and I didn’t know I could retake said quiz, so I got an 85%. This caused them to freak out and tell me if by next week all of my classes werent A’s, they would stop paying for my college and my health insurance. Also I am paying for my car registration, car insurance, my food, my gas and $50 a month in rent to them. That totals to about $1,100 a month in cost for me. And any extra money I do have, goes to them to pay back for helping me with my car loan. They’re upset because I’m struggling to pay all my bills and that I’m spending money going out with friends. Recently I went on a small vacation with friends and confided in my step dad that I drank with said friends. This was said in confidence. But during the discussion about my classes/grade he brought up me drinking to my mom and she flipped out on me. I understand I shouldn’t have been drinking at 20, but I was on a vacation with friends and I just wanted to have some fun with them. (I have never done this before, and I never go to parties or sneak out or do anything illegal) My mom is incredibly upset with me for drinking, and my stepdad is upset with me for spending money on things other than bills. Am I delusional to be mad? Every time I express anger or frustration towards my situation they tell me how they were doing so much more than me at my age and that I should be grateful they are paying for my school, and letting me live with them. I am grateful for both of those things but I am also upset about other things. I also struggle with severe depression and I have hypersomnia which really affects how I work and study, but they keep telling me to get over it. I am so close to quitting college, selling my car and moving out. I can’t handle the way they treat me. Am I overreacting?

He’s decided to have a really small wedding just a handful of close friends and family and he’s not inviting my husband (30M).\n\nTo give you some background, my brother has never really liked my husband and they’ve had their fair share of disagreements over the years. I always thought that regardless of their differences, family should come together for important moments like this. When I expressed my disappointment about my husband not being invited, my brother told me it’s his wedding and he wants it to be intimate with people he feels comfortable around.\n\nI felt pretty strongly about it and told him that I wouldn’t be attending if my husband wasn’t invited. For me, it’s a package deal. My husband and I are a team and it just feels unfair to make me choose between supporting my brother and supporting my husband. Now my brother is upset and thinks I’m being dramatic, saying I’m putting him in a tough position.\n\nTo complicate things, some family members have jumped in, saying I’m being unreasonable and that my brother deserves to have the wedding he wants without feeling guilty about inviting someone he doesn’t want there. I believe in family loyalty, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m overreacting by saying I won’t go.\n\n\nEdit: I’m sorry I was so vague in my post, to answer some questions yes everyone else’s significant others were invited, no my husband is not homophobic (he’s lgbtq) and they don’t get along because my husband is into video games and comics and my brother sees that as childish and a waste of time, on top of that, my husband is pretty introverted and shy whereas my brother is extroverted so my brother sees him as a “buzzkill”.", "assistant": "NTA - family loyalty is so important.

My 15 year old son lives with him and i only see him every other weekend and his little brother who lives with me currently also barely sees him on weekends as well because he ALWAYS has something going on.\n\nFootball games, quinceanera practice for his friend, homecoming, football practice.  I find I am always needing to switch weekends or lose time or drive an hour to pick him up from his events.  Just this weekend (my weekend) I had to drive all the way an hour to his city to pick up my son because he had a quinceanera that I didn’t agree to and his dad could not help with because he was not in town.  He basically told me it was up to me if I wanted to let him go or not?? But he could have cancelled his vacation he planned to switch weekends with me.\n\nSo my ex went on vacation over memorial day weekend.  Apparently he was flying back Monday early afternoon, but due to hail and thunder??? His flight got delayed for 5-6 hours and he told me he wasn’t going to be able to meet up at the halfway point until 845 pm (normal pick up time is 730 pm). \n\nI told him no, that won’t work and he needs to drive to my house (an extra hour total) to get our son.\n\nMy view is: its his fault for going on vacation and if he really cared about our son he would have made sure he was there on time to pick him up at 730 pm.

If he drives from the airport to my house and then from my house to his house, our son would lose an entire hour he could use to review.  If I met him at 845 pm, his son would be home by 915 pm vs 1015 pm. He says its my decision to give up my time instead of just driving him to practice and that the football and social events are things our son wants to do so I should be putting him first?? And that I am not putting him first and being unnecessarily inflexible by refusing to drive 25 minutes to the meet up points at 845 pm. He was also very insulting to my boyfriend saying its too bad he can’t step up and help me with the baby and our younger son so I can drop off our older son.

I don’t really know how my dad and this woman started dating but it was almost as if she was wiping up my mom even living there, I walked in on them laying on the bed together, and being a little closer than they should of been. Ever since that happened, I knew that I wasn’t going to get along with her, forward 4 months, my aunt came down with her kids to stay for 3 weeks, long story short, aunt found out about the girlfriend, aunt cut the trip halfway through the first week. My dad is still wondering why they cut the trip not even a week in. on my birthday I didn’t get to pick where I wanted to eat, her 7 year old did, it was almost as if I was now being wiped from the picture. About 1 week ago, I was coming back from school, I heard my dads door rip open, she was speed-walking towards me then said with a cocky attitude, “don’t you remember what you called your dad this morning?” I said I didn’t call him anything, she replied with “Pussy ass bitch? You don’t remember saying that?” Then she walked away. Forward to today I was woken up this morning by my dad yelling at me on how I left the fridge in the garage open, I said, maybe you should take a look on the hinges I know I closed it last night, then he walked out the door, and then this girlfriends brother decided to say, “why did you tell him to shut the fuck up?” I tried to fight that but he just got up and walked out. 5 minutes later I get a call from my dad I pick the phone, the first thing he says to me, “I just got a long message saying you’ve been cussing me out from behind my back, your done” then the phone hung up.

My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything.\n\nI do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques.  It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two.\n\nThe only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted.\n\nI've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home.\n\nI offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time.\n\nOne of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all.\n\nThen they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids.\n\nI came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage.\n\nShe told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her.\n\nSince then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head. I didn't intend for that or to make her feel guilty at all.\n\nI don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice.

Last year, I asked her if she gave something from just her as well and if that was why they thanked only her? She said no, but since she was the one who handed the gift basket to them and wrote the card (there were 3 others inc. me who built the actual baskets, she just insisted on doing the card), they maybe misunderstood (note that she always does this first thing in the morning and will take the basket from our office and go up by herself regardless if people say they'd like to join her, and just say she \"forgot\" they wanted to come with)...\n\nWell, I checked with one of the assistants because I am petty. The assistant told me that while the card said that it was from the staff, it did say \"*name of the lady* and the rest of the staff\", and that the same thing had happened the year before.\n\nAt the time, I did not say anything and just made a note of it for this year.\n\nNow, here's where I may have been a bit of an AH: This year, this lady once again sent out an email asking everyone to contribute a minimum of $30/per person for these 3 people. One of the owners retired earlier in the year, but she felt he'd still really appreciate a gift. I answered the email and said: \"Dear *name*, thank you for reaching out regarding this. I have given a lot of thought to this throughout the year, and have decided to organize my own gift this year instead with a smaller amount as it’s been a tough year financially for me and many others. Perhaps you can edit last year's card to say: \"Love from *her name* and the rest of the staff, except for *my name*? Thank you, and happy holidays!\"\n\nAbout 5 minutes after I sent the email, she came storming over and told me that I had no right to accuse her of taking credit for the gifts and not including everyone's name. I asked if it was untrue that that's what her card said last year - to which she answered that that's how she's always written the card. Apparently, she's currently scrambling, because a lot of other staff members are choosing not to join her gift this year, and her friend (F60) has told me that it was super petty and \"not very much in the spirit of Christmas of me to ruin the gift to management this year\" while grumbling about how selfish I and other younger staff members are who don't want to contribute to the gift.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole in this situation?\n\nEdit to add: Clarification that the minimum sum was $10 per gift, which is $30 in total for each staff-member, sorry if that was unclear (english is not my first language as much as I feel like I’m fluent, haha). Also: Thank you to everyone who answered so far, I definitely did not realize this was not common practice as I was told it was!", "assistant": "NTA At the very least, they should have passed around a card for everyone to sign.  \n\nI also think it's shitty to expect the employees to pitch in for a gift for (the presumably better paid) management."}

I'll call them Cassandra (17F) and Layla (15F). Two years ago, Luku (2M) (their biological younger brother, absolute light of my life, best boy) was born and surrendered, so he was placed with us too.\n\nSince they were adopted as preteens, a major priority for my parents was bonding with them two-on-three. And they go to a lot of bonding things. They’re constantly bouncing between adoption therapy, family therapy (which feels weird because I’m also part of the family? I’m only included once in a while, usually to be told I need to be less of a show off), and every single bonding thing they can find. They also take them out after individual therapy, which I 100% support and would never admit to being jealous of IRL but… \\*god\\* I’m jealous of it.\n\nI know it’s not the same, but I had six bouts over the summer and it was a miracle that they attended two. Which did not include the last fight or the Family Day. At least come for the catharsis of seeing me get whacked with a sword!\n\nSometimes circumstances demand that I’m there - and I moved my schedule to make this happen more often. At first they let me hang to the side, but then they asked that I step back so I’m not engaging with whatever it is they’re doing with my sisters because the bonding activities are supposed to be for them.\n\nLast night, I told my parents that I wanted them to do things with me, alone. That they were wildly favoring my siblings over me, and I wanted to have dinner on my birthday with only them. They didn’t take it well, and threatened to send me to therapy. We ate in silence for a few minutes.\n\nI tried to tell them I won the season-long bracket, and they emphasized how much it was not a time to be bragging or doing anything except apologizing. They said my siblings are traumatized and in need of more support. They also accused me of believing my siblings aren’t ‘real’ just because I wanted to have some time with my parents where it wasn’t about my siblings.\n\nAfter dinner, Layla said she thought it was a good idea, and suggested we go out as a family but paying attention to me in particular for the whole week. That sounds incredibly embarrassing but amazing - I’d adore that, especially since I want to hang out with my sisters more anyway.\n\nCassandra, though, pulled me aside and said that I had always been a spoiled asshole, but that this was like a healthy man demanding stitches from a poorly stocked first aid kit because everyone else had them and he wanted to \"feel special\". She said I should take a step back and realize that that was a awful thing to ask.\n\nI’m split between wanting to run away so my family doesn’t have to deal with me and sinking into the comfort of self-pity. I just want my own parents - or my own siblings or somebody - to genuinely care about how I feel or be glad when I do something well.", "assistant": "NTA trauma healing is not a poorly stocked first aid kit where supplies only go to those most in need. Requesting 1 b-day dinner with only your parents so you guys can chat is not a rude thing to ask (it's not like you were expecting every week or something, just 1 meal out of the whole year). You are allowed to feel ignored and want to be acknowledged at least sometimes. I mean, they're also allowed to say no they can't make it happen (since they would be footing the bill I assume), but I don't get that whole \"apologize for having feelings & needs\" reaction. \n\nMaybe take them up on the offer to go to therapy and tell your therapist you feel ignored and that you feel that your emotional needs for validation aren't being met. They could likely offer you quality advice about how to handle the situation, give you advice on things like what to say and how to tell your parents. Therapists can be an amazing resource to talk to about how to navigate social situations and how to effectively communicate your needs to others in a healthy way. \n\nBecause yes your siblings have needs, but your needs & feelings matter too. Everyone matters, there's no need for the \"trauma olympics\" Because seriously? My parents were abusively neglectful & had 5 kids, but I still got \"only me\" time with each of my parents. It was rare, but like it was there."}

I thought it was strange that she reacted like this, but let it go. \n\nThen after I was back at my desk, she came up to me and said that my question was inappropriate, that she was planning on announce the gender herself but I \"forced\" her to say it like that in an elevator, so now half of our team knows and it \"killed the magic\". I was honestly really confused and apologised profusely. She lectured me on how I shouldn't be asking personal questions and walked away. \n\nI honestly couldn't have thought this was in any way a personal question. Is it too personal? I'm a 24 year old dude and I don't know anything about pregnant women or babies or social customs, I guess. I was just trying to be friendly. AITA?", "assistant": "NTA. That’s a completely normal question to ask when someone announces they’re pregnant. If she wanted to announce it herself and surprise the team, she could’ve easily told you she was keeping the gender a surprise for now."}

Some of it comes from having worked in restaurants most of my life, but me and my sister also frequently got sick from my grandmother's cooking when we were kids.\n\nMy husband (36M) tends to handwave my \"obsession\" with food safety. It wasn't a big issue until he started learning to cook in earnest about 3-4 years ago. He's no careless buffoon, but when my suggestions are more conservative than Reddit's consensus, he'll get cranky about it. (Ex: if I suggest that he temp something that is almost certainly cooked through, he'll roll his eyes and do it begrudgingly.)\n\nTwo weeks ago, as we're unpacking groceries, one of the condiments looks off to me; it's too dark, the oil looks separated, and I strongly suspect it's spoiled. He's the one who buys/eats it, so instead of throwing it away, I point it out to him: \"Hey, this looks weird and I don't think you should eat it. Take a photo, ask for a refund, and throw it away.\" He inspects it and agrees that it looks weird but still puts it in the pantry. Over the next few days, as I notice he hasn't thrown it away, I bring it up a few more times to no avail and eventually drop it.\n\nA few days ago, he texts me to say he has to stop working early (he works from home) because he threw up twice. He's hardly ever sick, so I'm like wtf?? Later, when I get an explanation: HE ATE THE DAMN SAUCE and puked it up less than 3 hours afterwards. I'm annoyed, but he looks miserable, so I crush my annoyance down to the size of a pebble, make him a glass of electrolytes, and set him up on the couch with a wastebasket and Darkest Dungeon 2. Additional context for my annoyance: I have a doctor's appointment the next day, and he agreed to come with me weeks ago; I'm nervous about the appointment and don't have anyone else to ask on short notice. The timing sucks, tbh.\n\nFortunately, the acute phase is over quickly; he's back to 90% (his estimate) the next day and comes with me to the doctor. I've been pretty accommodating up to then, but as he's making himself food, I can't contain it anymore. \"I wasn't going to say 'I told you so' while you were sick, but since you're feeling better: I TOLD you that sauce was off, I TOLD you to throw it away, and look what happened. Hope you learned a lesson.\" An argument follows. His points: he checked the expiration date (fine); he smelled it first (fine); him getting sick was a fluke, everything worked out, and I'm being an AH for acting like I knew it would get him sick. My point: I WAS RIGHT.\n\nNow we're at a stalemate; if y'all think I was the AH for kicking him while he was still 10% down, then I promise to apologize. Otherwise, I'm sticking to my guns.\n\nEdit: Didn't expect this to blow up! I'm not much of a Reddit person, but I'll address a few things I see in the comments just for closure's sake. \n\n1) It was definitely the sauce that got him sick. He works from home and can't drive, so he pretty much never leaves the house, we don't have children, nobody's been over in the last week, the timing made it pretty obvious (he literally only threw up twice and it was right after he ate), and I never got sick despite being around him. He threw it away!\n\n2) Some folks are saying that \"food poisoning\" doesn't set in that quickly, but it definitely can, and it's pretty easy to Google that, so you can do that if you want. There are cool charts and everything!\n\n3) Obviously the character limit reduces stories like these to their bones and leaves them open to infection with whatever twisted personal fantasy you want to project onto them, but for the record: he and I both got a huge laugh at everyone foaming at the mouth to tell me how horrible I sound; we've known each other since we were 14, we are best friends, and we both have anxieties that might make us seem insufferable to other people (see: he doesn't drive), but we do our best and love each other anyway.\n\n4) I apologized, but so did he. Everybody won.", "assistant": "NTA. He was warned, you’re not his mom, he chose to eat it. Maybe the I told you so was a little petty, but you weren’t wrong."}

She said the biggest celebration she got was her parents telling her she did “not bad” after she graduated with her masters and bought her some pastries. Apparently no celebration after her undergrad because that was the bare minimum. Its caused to some issues between us.\n\nSpecifically that I like to have a birthday month and she just rolls her eyes at it. She will have a birthday meal with me but she refuses to acknowledge my birthday after the date. At my house growing up the birthday person was given special treatment their entire month.

My girlfriend less so, but she still generally expects to have a child together in the future (a non-negotiable expectation I have expressed from the get-go). When discussing our future children, and specifically the aspect of their names, she has always deferred to me for choosing them, not expressing strong opinions about them. As such, for a few years now I have had a static list of names chosen that I would love for our children, and she has always agreed. \n\nHowever, 9 months ago my girlfriend grew a strong conviction for a name of a daughter. She became enamoured with this name when she recently learned it was her great grandmother's name. Frankly, for several small reasons, I do not like this name. I told this to her when she first mentioned it and she was very offended, although I was just being transparent with her. When she told me it was to honor her great grandmother I felt bad about it and said it was a fine name.

Last Christmas, my parents told us our gift would be a family trip to Universal Studios this coming Christmas. My mom bought the hotel and park tickets and asked if we wanted to go, saying we would all fly. Of course I said yes, I was excited and thought it would be a fun trip.\n\nFor some background, my parents are extremely wealthy doctors who own their own business. None of us kids are financially comfortable. I'm a broke college student who recently took a year off after leaving an abusive relationship and struggling with depression. During that time I had no job or income. I'm starting school again this fall and looking for work, but I currently have very low funds.\n\nMy siblings aren't better off. My youngest brother is 16. My sisters (21 and 24) both work minimum wage and already struggle. On top of that, my mom charges anyone over 18 $600 a month in rent to live in our (very large) family house. The only sibling doing okay is my 27-year-old brother who works for my parents.\n\nFast forward to now (August), a few months before the trip, and the terms suddenly changed. My dad chickened out of flying because of his severe anxiety and wants to drive instead (16 hours vs. a 2-hour flight). My mom and I both get motion sickness, but for me it's extreme. I panic about getting sick in cars, so a 16-hour drive is my nightmare.\n\nBecause my dad won't fly, my mom announced: \"You kids need to pay for your own flights now. For the two youngest who don't have any money, the rest of you can pitch in to buy their tickets - or they'll have to drive in their own cars. This is a test of sibling loyalty.\"\n\nI felt awful because I don't want my siblings, who are already broke, to pay for me. I told my mom I want to come, but I probably won't go if it meant they had to to cover my ticket. She snapped and called me \"ungrateful\" for not wanting to go on a trip she's \"spending so much money on,\" saying if I don't go I'm throwing her generosity back in her face.\n\nSo now I feel stuck. If I go, my siblings may be pressured into paying for me. If I don't, I'll be labeled ungrateful for wasting her money AND my little brother won't have a ride/my siblings will have to pay for him. If I drive, I'll have panic attacks and be sick and miserable which I definitely don't want.\n\nAITA for telling my mom I probably won't go if it means my siblings have to pay for me?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a bit, my dad wants my mom to go with him in the car. So since she isn't flying now (and is very pissed about it), that's why we all have to pay. She said there's only room for two, so that's why my brother wouldn't have a ride if I didn't drive him.\n\nUPDATE (kinda): I spoke with my siblings about everything and they said they would do whatever they had to so I could come because they really wanted me there for Christmas. I still insisted that I did not want them to pay. I had a talk with my grandparents about the situation (I often go to them to vent about these kind of issues with my family, they aren't huge fans of my parents and how they handle things). They take me on a lot of trips, especially recently we went on a huge trip together to Alaska, and they said they made an account for me and put all of the miles on there for me to use in the future. So (hopefully) I might have enough miles to pay for a flight there and back. I really don't want to let my siblings down and I'm very close with them - they said they would rather split the money to have me there than have me not come at all. Still thinking about it but thank you to everyone for the suggestions. And as for the comments about the toxic environment. I am aware it is borderline emotionally abusive and am spending the next couple years to save up so I can move out. Same with my siblings. That's why it's so hard to ask for money from them, because I know we are all reaching towards the same goal of saving up to move out. I'll update on the situation if anything else happens, thanks for the support.", "assistant": "NTA. This isn't a gift: it's a carefully crafted piece of abuse.

We’ve been arguing about so many trivial things. Last week, he randomly asked me if I liked eating s’mores. I said I don’t care for them and rarely do I ever crave them. He then asked me what I thought of cabins and camping. I told him I don’t care for either to be honest and the only way I would go camping is if it was a glamping experience. He nodded and said noted. \n\nToday he tells me to be ready and dressed by 4 pm because we have a date planned. I put on a cute outfit because all he told me was we have a special date planned. Any other time he’s said that, the date usually involves us going out to a fancy restaurant. So I put on a skirt, some heels, and a top. He sees my outfit, doesn’t say anything. The only thing I noticed that was odd was that he brought his backpack with him. I asked him why, and he said that he just wanted to put his hoodie somewhere in case it got cold later. \n\nWe get into the car and 20 minutes into the drive I ask him how far is the restaurant we’re going to. He smiles and says, “about an hour”. I pull up my phone and start responding to some work emails to kill time. And then when we arrived to our destination I honestly got so upset. It was a super tiny trailer in the middle of the West Virginia woods. There was a small picnic table outside and just woods. I ask him what we were doing there and he turns to me and says, “surprise! we’re having a couple’s retreat. Do you like it?” I walk inside the trailer and mind you, my husband knows I am extremely claustrophobic. There is no room inside this trailer. I start panicking because a. I need physical space b. I’m in HEELS AND A SKIRT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS c. HE PACKED PJS, his toothbrush, AND A CHANGE OF CLOTHES BUT DIDNT THINK TO TELL ME ID BE NEEDING ANYTHING FOR THIS DATE. \n\nAt that point I just blatantly ask him, “have I ever expressed any interest in camping to you?” He said, “no.” And then I followed up with, “you know how much I hate small spaces, what made you think I’d enjoy this, I just really want to understand?” He didn’t say anything. I told him I appreciated the gesture but I could not for the life of me figure out how he thought planning this in the way he did was going to help get us out of a rut. \n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s planned something for me that I hated. And the worst thing, I’ve told him before if I’ve never expressed interest in something to please not gift it to me or plan a date around it. I do a very good job at giving him extremely thoughtful gifts and planning him very thoughtful dates/experiences. And today I told him that it just seems like there isn’t any consideration for me in that regard. Am I the asshole for reacting the way that I did?", "assistant": "NTA\n\nI'm bewildered by the idea of him planning a camping/outdoor/overnight type of event, not even hinting that you dressing up for going out to dinner was a problem, and NOT bringing along any toiletries or extra clothing for you.\n\nWhat was going on in this man's brain? \"I'm going to bring my wife out into the woods in inappropriate clothing and with nothing for her to change into or sleep in, and she's going to be happy about it?\" I don't necessarily mind camping but this entire experience would feel disrespectful and piss me the heck off."}

My parents time and attention has to be focused on him more than on me. For the first few years after he was born I spent a lot of time with my grandpa who raised me from the age of 2 until I was about 7 and then I was seen as \"old enough\" to be at home after school and could make my own food and clean up after myself and not need supervision mostly. Grandpa was willing, and had offered, to keep taking me after school but my parents said he didn't need to do it and he deserved to live his life.\n\nI never get 1:1 time with my parents. They couldn't afford field trips and never took the time to apply for the school field trip fund so grandpa picked up the slack there. He paid into my school lunch account so I didn't have to make my own lunch. Grandpa was the person who'd pick me up from school if I was sick. He'd stay and take care of me at home since whichever parent would be home would really just say to go to bed or lay on the couch and relax and there was no caring for me or taking care of sick little me.\n\nWhen I was 11 I got picked for this junior programmers contest through our school district but my parents said they couldn't take the time for it so they refused to sign off and since grandpa couldn't, even though he offered to take me, I missed out on that.

My daughter insists he doesn't care, but I still push it. \n\nThe last time we were over, she did it again. She was playing basketball out in their backyard when she came inside and just took a soda. I met her in the kitchen and told her to put it back and ask my brother if she could have a can. She refused and started walking the other way until I told her again, to do what I said. She still didn't and I didn't continue the argument as we weren't at home, but when we got in the car I told her that I wouldn't let her come there anymore if she couldn't just ask a question. She started arguing with me about it, and I told her that if she had just done what i had asked her to, it wouldn't be an issue. \n\nMy daughter is still kind of mad at me about the whole thing, so AITA?", "assistant": "YTA. If your brother doesn’t care and they have a literal drinks fridge, why is this an issue with you? I don’t care how you were raised, his house his rules when it comes to something this inconsequential."}

Jay is a gay man and had a crush on my brother ever since they first met, my brother on the other hand was very vocal about being straight. 5 years ago he met his now ex-fiancé (27F) who we will call May. May is a sweet and stunning lady, and I don’t know how my brother bagged her, but I suppose miracles happen. Their “wedding” was 4 days ago, and I still feel a little bad. A day before the wedding me and Jay were hanging out and doing outfit prep, during this he went to the bathroom, and while he was in the bathroom he got a text from my brother, I was curious so I checked it out, and that’s how I found out that for the past 2 years my brother has been having an affair with Jay! (He proposed a year ago) It was late, and I didn’t know what to do, so I decided in the morning before the wedding I would confront my brother. When I confronted him, he told me that he wasn’t going to break off his affair because he was straight, so it wasn’t cheating. I should also mention that he told Jay that he got permission from May to have their “sex sessions”(this was a lie). My brother used Jays bad luck in finding partners and the fact he is crushing on him for his own pleasure, and I couldn’t stand for it. I was in shock. I wasn’t sure what to do, but when we were asked if there were any objections, I spoke up, I said that this couldn’t happen because my brother has been having an affair with Jay, and that he lied to Jay about what it was, he even told Jay not to tell anyone because he wasn’t out yet, when in truth he was just toying with him! After May and Jay both heard the truth they were distraught, May through her ring and ran out the wedding and Jay started balling. Now I’m getting flooded with texts, some saying I’m an asshole, some saying it wasn’t the right time, some saying I did the right thing. That’s not what I care about though. Jay is currently locked up in his apartment and won’t talk to anyone, expect the occasional thank you text for me bringing him food. My brother is furious. The one positive is that May thanked me and we have plans to go out for brunch Sunday. So Reddit, what do you think? I know I could’ve done some things better but I was overwhelmed and confused, am I the asshole? \nEdit: I should clarify that I didn’t say it was Jay that my brother was having an affair with, and the reason I didn’t tell May before was because I couldn’t reach her at the time. I have no good reason I couldn’t have spoken to Jay privately. I was just confused and taken aback. No excuses to be had.\n\nEdit: To clarify my brother is still saying he is straight and using that as an excuse. He knows it was wrong or he wouldn’t have lied to Jay. We are surrounded by supportive people, and I myself am an ally. If he wants to come out he can but I won’t force him to.", "assistant": "YTA for expecting us to believe this."}

Why was he so insistent on getting more info before intervening?\n\nThe initial ‘incident’ was that MIL bought the kids some fairground toys.\n\nThis isn’t as simple as it seems.\n\nI tried to give enough context in the post, but I now realise not enough. \n\nMIL has a compulsive spending habit, and regularly buys gifts to excess. \n\nNot just kindly grandma indulging her grandkids, but hoarder level, armfuls of bags from charity shops, boxes & boxes full of things.   \n\nWe are completely overwhelmed by all the stuff. I’m constantly donating or recycling but our house is always cluttered & it’s stressful.\n\nWe’ve tried everything to redirect her generosity. Boundaries, limits, talking, agreeing “allowed” categories, experiences instead of things, anything she buys stays at her house, “one in one out” … nothing works.  \n\nShe keeps showing up with stuff and then fights us about it.\n\nAnd she has no income and very little money. She will soon be dependent on us. This isn’t a rich grandma with money to burn.\n\nAnd my husband has climate anxiety, worried about waste, microplastics etc. We aren’t perfect but try our best to be relatively eco in other areas of life.\n\nFor outings with the kids, we all agree beforehand what MIL can buy them.\n\nBut both parents need to be on the same page, or she claims she didn’t get the memo & comes home with several new gifts for each child.   \n\nThe kids are overwhelmed too! Too many toys to keep up with.  Although they help decide what to donate, it’s confusing why grandma does this even though she’s been asked not to. Then she criticises them bitterly for being spoiled with too many toys, yet she’s the one buying all the junk.\n\nAt the fairground, she said she forgot her wallet and had no way to pay.\n\nSo that day I had not pre-agreed any gifts with her; I saw no need.\n\nWhen my husband joined us later, he knew she had forgotten her wallet but didn’t know if she and I had agreed anything further about spending.\n\nSo when he saw her get out the Apple Pay (which we had never seen her use before) but without any background knowledge on what we might have negotiated, he panicked.\n\nHe didn’t want to jump in & stop her, because if we contradict each other, she ignores future requests and picks fights about how we can’t even decide what we mean.\n\nBut his panic - and the many comments pointing out this is not healthy - showed me how hypervigilant he has become around her.\n\nI realised he’s suffering from a pathological anxiety about this whole thing (MIL’s purchasing compulsion) and the panic/fight with me was not healthy or appropriate.   \n\nHe wanted to find a way we could have prevented it, but he was too overwhelmed to stay calm.\n\nI decided to start treating it like he has an anxiety disorder, and that is really helping me to support him and myself without “making myself wrong”, which was the only previous conclusion.  \n\n\n_____\nOriginal Post: (Forgive me, it’s difficult to read because I was confused & emotional, and trying to get in under the character limit). People post here on their worst day, as the FAQs point out! )\n\nOP:\n\n\nI went to a local funfair with my kids & mother in law (MIL).\n\nWe decided to walk around looking at all the rides before deciding what to go on. \n\nMIL had forgotten her wallet so it would be me buying any rides. (This let me relax about the sometimes tricky dynamic of who is paying for what.)\n\nAs we walked past a prize stall (pay money to win a prize), MIL commented in shock at the high price & I agreed.\n\nAt the next ride, my husband joined us. He & I were chatting when we noticed that MIL had gone back to the previous prize stall with the kids.\n\nHe asked urgently what I had agreed with her about that stall, & I (slightly confused at his urgency) remembered we had both thought it overpriced.\n\nI knew she didn’t have money on her so I assumed they had just gone back to look.\n\nWe have disagreed with MIL many times about her excessive (in our view) gifts for the kids. Each visit she buys toys which soon get discarded, or more sweets & snacks than the kids can eat.\n\nThis is important to us because (a) we want to teach the kids moderation & value rather than excessive disposable expenditure, (b) we are worried about the environment & the excess of toys contributes to landfill, (c) while she has the right to use her money, the amount spent on this stuff feels wasteful when it could be used for more lasting things for the kids.\n\nBack to the fun fair.\n\nMy husband insisted I tell him what I had “agreed” with MIL. We hadn’t agreed anything, I told him. We agreed it was priced too high?\n\nI then noticed she had taken out her phone to pay using her contactless payment.\n\nHusband said he didn’t want her buying it, & I said he should go tell her. He insisted he didn’t want to do that before finding out what I had agreed with her. \n\nI told him if he could see what was happening he should go & stop her.\n\nBy now it was finished & I said look it’s done now, it’s her money to spend & if she wants to have fun with the kids by spending £15 on a prize stall that’s up to her, & that I hadn’t “agreed” anything with her as I believed she had forgotten her wallet.\n\nAfter we got home he picked a huge fight with me, telling me he was really distressed by the landfill of the prizes (the toys are already falling apart), & the repeated messages this kind of spending sends to the kids about the value of things. \n\nHis main complaint at me is that when we first saw the stall before he joined us, he insists I should have told MIL not to buy it for the kids, & the facts that (a) I believed she had no means of paying & (b) had commented on how overpriced it was were not relevant, I still should explicitly have said that we didn’t want her to buy anything. \n\nI think this is unreasonable & would have made things really awkward at what was supposed to be a fun outing.\n\nHe says it’s my fault that MIL spent her money on poor quality prizes which will be landfill by next week.\n\nWas it my fault?", "assistant": "NTA. Your husband should be the one speaking with his mother about things like that. It's strange that he expected you to anticipate what his mother would do.

We met as junior enlisted soldiers; he is now an NCO and I commissioned as an officer last summer. In the military, our relationship (officer and enlisted) isn’t allowed  but since we met and have been in a romantic relationship since we were both junior enlisted we have regulations to follow regarding the timeline of our marriage. \n\nI had this vision of having a wedding on September 21st & doing a full blown disco for it (Do you remember the 21st night of September? Sick… I know) We toured a venue in February, we set our date with them to be September 21, 2024, and we went on our merry way planning; my best friend involved every step of the way as my matron of honor. I was not supposed to commission until the fall of 2023. Upon my graduation my state contacted me and wanted to fedrec me as soon as they possibly could which lead me to me commissioning in July 2024 instead & threw off our entire plan for our wedding. We, by regulation, had one year from my commissioning date to marry or terminate our relationship & a wedding ceremony already planned and booked for a date that was beyond that. We decided to elope on what would be our anniversary date anyways and keep the secret from everyone but our parents.\n\nOn September 21, 2023 we had an intimate ceremony with just, my parents, his dad, & stepmom. We have spent the last 11 months planning our ceremony this year to break the news to everyone that they are in fact not in attendance of our wedding but instead a giant first anniversary party and see the shock on everyone’s faces! Until last night. \n\nI had my bridal shower yesterday. My parents, my best friend, & her husband stayed back to help us clean & my dad drunkenly let it slip that we got married last year and my best friend is PISSED. Her husband is pissed. He kept saying he can’t believe we “didn’t trust them” with the secret. She kept saying that she wouldn’t keep anything from me for a year. I told her she was the one person I couldn’t wait to find out, I couldn’t wait to see her reaction on the big day the most. I was so excited to surprise HER specifically with the news. They just weren’t happy. They both left I texted her saying I just wanted to surprise them with everyone else she didn’t answer for hours & when she finally did she said she wasn’t mad she’s just hurt and wants to get together to talk over both sides.\n\nI can see where she’d be upset because her sister did something similar this year where she eloped and didn’t tell the family before hand or invite them, but they also had friends present instead of family and other people were in the know outside of family. We didn’t tell ANYONE. Our parents, and those who are in the army around us that were necessary to know; but the whole point of our wedding ceremony next month is to surprise everyone. Even my husband’s best friend has no idea. So aita for not telling her either?", "assistant": "YTA\n\nThis isn’t about getting married then wanting to celebrate later. This isn’t about your bff not being at the wedding.\n\nFor a year, you have been lying to them, having them help you plan this event, getting them excited to share this life changing event with you, only to find out it’s a big joke. \n\nI’m sure if you had told her the story, then explained you still wanted to have the whole experience, she would be on board. But no, she had to be the butt of a prank. \n\nWhen you talk, they very well may apologize and say they’re totally okay with it. That won’t change that you were an AH to them."}

From the neighbors that have came up to me, everyone has been very friendly and welcoming which I really appreciate since I'm not from around the town.\n\nI have noticed that some neighbors have been having frequent parties the last couple of weeks but I chalked it up to it being celebrations since I know one neighbor's daughter just graduated highschool, and July 4th is coming up. I have been to some of these parties to get to know the other neighbors better and one person who really stands out to me is this one neighbor, Melinda. (Not her actual name) \nAt a neighbors party she came up to me and introduced herself and we talked for a while. This is when I learned about the \"Newest Neighbor Party\". Apparently, the newest neighbor is supposed to throw a grand party showing off their home and entertain the neighborhood as a whole thing. Melinda told me since I was the newest neighbor, it was my duty to.  thought Melinda was joking when she told me this as it didn't make sense to me and I laughed. This seemed to have had made Melinda a little angry, as she said she was serious and it was a tradition in the neighborhood and that I had 2 weeks to host a party. \n\nThis was 2 weeks ago. Yesterday was the day I was supposed to do this \"tradition\" but I happily stayed in bed. Melinda and a couple neighbors came and rang on the doorbell but I ignored them and enjoyed binge watching childhood shows. I decided to go outside today and Melinda came up to me furious, saying that I didn't do the tradition and that I was being a bad neighbor. \n\nThe thing is however, I asked some other people about this \"tradition\" and they have heard some people do it, but mostly never really mentioned it to be a reaccuring thing that each new person in the neighborhood should do. I told Melinda that I wouldn't be throwing a party anytime soon as I didn't feel comfortable with the thought of people coming into my home let alone me having to entertain them. \nMelinda got angry, saying that the neighborhood is like a \"big family\" and stormed off. I let it go, but the neighbors that were with Melinda at my house that night have been telling me I should've just did the party and that I'm leaving a bad impression. \n\nI think my reason is justified, but I'm not really sure. So AITA? \n\nThank you for all the comments and suggestions. \nI also see where I could've told Melinda that I wasn't comfortable, but from the one to two interactions I've had with her, it sounds like she wouldn't have cared regardless, but I don't want to assume. \nA lot of suggestions  were very insightful and funny. \nAfter I posted this I went to sleep, and decided to go out today. I didn't bump into Melinda or any of her friends, so I'm not sure about her. However some neighbors have offered to help me continue to move in by bringing boxes in. \nOne of these neighbors, John (not real name) has been living here for a while, and he told me he's not fond of Melinda and from what he has seen, some neighbors just try to avoid her or put up with her for the sake of it. \n\nSomeone messenged me asking how moving in was going and it has been going good but hopefully my mattress comes in soon so I can stop sleeping on the couch, it's rough. \n\nIf anything crazy happens or if Melinda comes up to me, I'll let you all know. But that's really it for now since it's only been a new day. \n\nUpdate: Melinda came up to me. \nI thought since she didn't bother me yesterday, today would be the same but it wasn't. I got out of my car and I saw Melinda ringing my doorbell like crazy and knocking hard. I got out my car and asked her what she was doing, and she looked at me and she just looked angry and demanded an apology. \nI asked her an apology for what and she's saying that Im going around asking people about the tradition and if I feel so highly about it that I should just do it like everyone else has. \nI think she's crazy. I told her get off my property and to leave me alone. I just left her outside because I didn't want to deal with her but i heard something fall outside and go to check a few minutes later and she kicked my plant. I guess we're in a war thing now? But who kicks plants out of rage..\n\nUpdate: Fourth of July \n\n\nHello everyone. Happy fourth. Melinda is crazy and I'm calli by it here and now. Since today is the fourth, everyone is having a big gathering in the street like a block party. I went to the store to get things for it such as hotdogs and burgers and some snacks for kids and adults because I couldn't cook anything personally. \nThe party is still happening, I'm writing this from the bathroom. \nWe had all of our stuff labeled so everyone knew who to thank, and the party was going good until I see Melinda at my area of the food and she's breaking some open. (I would be fine with this if there wasn't already hotdogs and hamburgers from other neighbors already being cooked, but the fact she skipped over about 3 other peoples stuff to open mines???) \nI went to her and asked her what is she doing and I guess she didn't expect me to see because she started going on a whole spew about me getting the wrong brand of hotdogs and stuff and how I need to think about the neighborhood. It was Sabrett, and everyone brought those types. Before I could even say anything she js walked off and luckily a neighbor saw my stuff open and offered to take it and put it in her freezer until its needed, and I'm in her house currently typing this. I feel like I'm in some weird tv show like the comments have been saying. This personal vendetta stuff is weird and annoying and it's over a home welcoming party. She's insane.", "assistant": "NTA\n\nLook, I love a neighborhood with a good, friendly community.

The wedding was set on a riverside farm and so we had photoshoots outside on the fields before the ceremony. We started taking photos around noon and my sister-in-law (30F) was one of the bridesmaids. SIL has always been a negative person since I met her, always trying to make small judgemental comments, while my wife is an incredibly kind person. They have very different personalities, so I never questioned why they aren't close and assumed that SIL was included in her group of bridesmaids to appease my wife's parents.   \n  \nBecause SIL and my wife have never been very close, she was at the end of the line of bridesmaids and usually was at the edges of group photos. While taking the photos, SIL was the only person complaining about things like the sunny weather and how her dress was \"absorbing heat.\" I don't know much about dresses but it was about 70°F. Most people in the photoshoot group ignored her comments and it wasn't an issue for the rest of the day.  \n  \nWe got the photos of both the shoot and the ceremony from the photographer 3 weeks after the wedding. We promptly sent the photos to the people in photoshoot and told them we planned on using the photos on social media. Most people thanked us for the photos but my SIL called my wife and was very angry, yelling that she \"looked like a fat pig\" in every photo she was in and demanded that we not use any of the photos with her in them. For context, SIL is bigger than my wife but not to an extreme extent. She doesn't look unhealthy and I've never heard her have body issues before but I admittedly wouldn't know much about it. In the wedding photos, she really doesn't look any different from her normal self.  \n  \nMy wife tried to reason with her, saying she looks just as pretty as everyone else but SIL did not want to hear it. She reiterated that if we used any photo of her on social media that she would never speak to us again and would \"put us on blast\" whatever that means. My wife was really hurt by her sister's outburst and I was very bothered that she thought she could tell us what to do with our special moment.  \n  \nHere's where I may be the asshole: I decided that if she had such a problem, she didn't need to be in the photos. I cropped her out and posted those versions to social media. I thought it would be fine and it was easy since she was at the edge anyway. After posting, she then called me even angrier than before and accused me of trying to \"erase her from the memory of the wedding.\" I told her I only did it to accomodate her wishes while also getting to use our own wedding photos. SIL hasn't talked to us in a week, my wife's parents are mad at us for upsetting SIL. While my wife is on my side, she thinks I could have been more mature about it. I don't think I did anything wrong and accommodated her already unreasonable request. So, am I the asshole?", "assistant": "NTA. You did exactly as she asked!

So I decided that my bridesmaids will wear empire waist dresses, like the ones seen in Bridgerton or Pride and Prejudice.\n\nNearly all of my bridesmaids love this idea. However, one of my bridesmaids (27F) is very mad at me for insisting that they wear empire waist dresses. She claims that the dress looks unflattering on her due to her body proportions. She has broad shoulders, a large chest, large arms, a small waist, and thin legs. She claims that due to the high waistline and her large chest, her waist appears much larger than it actually is. She also says that that type of dress emphasises her thick arms. She told me that those dresses made her look fat and triggered her past body dysmorphia and insecurities.\n\nShe asked me if she could modify her dress to define her figure, but I said all the bridesmaids had to wear the same dress and I didn’t want her to stand out. She said I was being selfish and that I wasn’t taking into account other people’s body types. I said she was acting extremely entitled, it’s my wedding and I shouldn’t have to cater to her insecurities. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA\n\nShe’s a person, not a prop.

I (42F) have two nieces Flo (14F), Ivy (11F) and a nephew Ryan (10M) through my bro Tom (46M) and SIL Kate (45F). Flo and Ivy are biologically theirs and they adopted Ryan two years ago after fostering him for three years. I live locally to them, we are super close usually and have my own daughter Ava (12F) who my nieces are close to. \n\nBefore foster care, Ryan’s life was awful and he has some behavioural and developmental issues. He struggles to sit through long things such as shows quietly, whether it be in the theatre or the girls’ plays/ recitals so the girls rarely have both parents supporting them. His behaviour is sometimes pretty unpredictable and he sometimes has pretty loud and physical meltdowns so they have to be careful where they take him. As such whenever me/hubby take Ava to the theatre or other activities which Ryan wouldn’t like, we bring the girls along too. Sometimes Tom and Kate pay for them, sometimes we do. We have never bought Ryan out without his parents and sisters because he has really different interests to the girls, I don’t feel confident handling his behaviour and Flo and Ivy have expressed that they really value the Ryan-free time. I’ve made extra effort to be there since then; Ryan’s a great kid but he needs a lot of attention and my nieces need people who are 100% in their corner.\n\nAnyways, I am taking the girls to a Christmas theme park in London on Friday. It’s quite an expensive one (UK readers, if you know, you know) and I have the joy of footing the bill for all three. On Sunday, I got a call from Kate asking if Ryan could come with us on Friday. He had seen adverts and heard the girls talking about it, and wants to go. She offered to pay for whatever he did. I told Kate no as I didn’t know what he was like in crowds, she said he went two years ago and loved it, and his sisters were there to help him if he was struggling. I said that wasn’t fair on them, I booked it as a girl’s trip and it is supposed to be a treat and I don’t want it getting cut short and I don’t feel comfortable parentifying the girls. I know Tom’s taking Ryan to London next week so told Kate to book tickets on that day, but by that point she wasn’t listening. She criticised me for insinuating siblings caring for eachother was parentifying me, and accused me of being ableist as Ryan can’t help his conditions and shouldn’t be excluded, as well has being biased against the kid I’m not related to. It got very fiery and ended with me saying read the room, it’s a girls day and her hanging up.\n\nAnyways, she went to the girls and said either they ask me for Ryan to come or they can’t go. Flo texted me begging to not let him come and asking if they can still join us, while Ivy is more torn up as she doesn’t want her brother to be left out but also doesn’t want to risk her day being ruined. My mother, Tom and sister have contacted me saying I should bring Ryan as to not show favourites and to be inclusive. Husband is on my side. AITA?\n\nedit to answer a few FAQs:\n\n\\- Tom, Kate and my husband are all working the day of the trip. I took PTO and Kate and Tom had childcare arranged.\n\n\\- I do spend quality time with Ryan. We live a 15 min walk away so go to their house often. Me, Ryan and Tom if he's around build a lot of Lego as it's a shared hobby and I get him a new set every birthday and Christmas, and it's a running joke as he spends a lot of time guessing which one. I like this quality time as it's accessible and his parents are around. I just book days out around my daughter's interests, which happen to be the exact opposite of his. She's a really artsy girly girl who likes the theatre, shopping, museums, movie nights and slumber parties while he's into lego, video games and anything martial arts.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThank you so much for everyone who commented, an absolutely crazy number!

My aunt wasn’t, but her husband is Muslim and her children, my cousins, are Muslim too. On my aunts final days her husband had been somewhat persuading my aunt to become Muslim (sorry if I didn’t say that right I’m not too caught up on the religion as I and my parents are atheist) and had been using her children against her, telling her that if she didn’t become Muslim they would not be allowed to pray or mourn her and that her children would not see her in the afterlife. 10 days before my aunt passed she became a Muslim, although, she decided not to wear a hijab as she never had liked wearing one and had worn one only once in the past to meet her husbands parents. After my aunt had sadly passed my uncle took to planning the funeral which was a Muslim funeral and was absolutely lovely. After the funeral her children and husband mourned. A few months ago (maybe 6) I wanted to create something for my aunt but needed photos and as my aunt wasn’t someone who took photos of herself I asked my cousins to which I either got no response or a little “sorry I don’t have any” or “ask my father for them” which I thought was strange as all over their social media there were photos of my aunt. I asked my mother to contact my uncle and his reply left me dumbfounded. He basically said that because she converted before she passed he could not show any photos of her without a hijab (so all her photos except one where she looks extremely uncomfortable) and that he could only show the male family members, he apologised but said that that was how his religion was and asked us to delete all photos where she didn’t have a hijab on in our phones or devices, I later also found out that he had deleted ALL of her social media which had only one or two photos of her but contained family photos and core memories and had no reason or excuse for deleting them. I talked to my mother and was told he had told my cousins that they could not post about my aunt or share any photos of her even with family. The other day I was looking in my room and found an old camera that had a card in it, when I put the card into my professional camera I discovered countless old photos of my aunt and me + my cousins when we were younger and I went through them with my mother which felt like a lovely experience in itself. My mother asked afterwards that I not show my cousins the photos until I had sent them to her but I told her I was not planning on telling them at all as my younger cousins could let slip I have them to my uncle and that would mean he would demand we delete them or try take them (he’s that kind of person) she gave me a weird look and said she thought it was unfair as it’s their mother and it has photos of them with her (mainly my cousins who are 16F and 14F but seeing as it was a camera given to me by my grandad she didn’t have much of a say in what I did. So, AITA?\n\nEdit to add: 2 months after she passed he was on dating sites and then this March / April he got married again\n\nUpdate: so, everything kind of blew up. I decided to send a photo to my cousin, explaining how I found “one” and she was very grateful, little did I know that my uncle could read her messages which she forgot to delete. I got a VERY angry phone call where (to sum it up) he said that I had to delete that photo as she wasn’t wearing a hijab and tell my cousin to delete the one I sent her or else he would make sure we never saw or heard from that side again and he would message my mother lies about me to get me in trouble. As I should be I was outraged and showed my mother all of the messages to which she then got on a very heated phone call with him and has said that if he doesn’t apologise we will not be speaking to him. She was mortified wirh what he said and did apologise to me after the call. Any ideas on what to do going forward will be very gratefully welcomed as I’m at a loss", "assistant": "NTA. \n\nIt may be unfair to them, but so is being coerced into changing religions on a deathbed.

There was a house she had purchased cash (she claims) for over $300k. Her mom passed away a few years prior when she was about 22 and she was able to receive a considerable amount of money from her mom’s passing in the form of life insurance money, which is how she afforded the home purchase.\n\nAt the moment she is completely broke. She has several part time jobs, but she is basically on her last few dollars. This led me to wonder where all the money from her house sale went since she would have total equity in the house if it was bought cash. I don’t see how someone could go through over $300,000 in 5 years. When I asked her about this she became very angry with me and told me I would never understand. She said she was a 22 year old girl with no other parents since her mom passed and her dad was not in her life so she had no other financial help.\n\nShe said she had to buy cars (she got in a wreck in one of her previous cars and got a large settlement from this). I don’t remember the exact amount, but I do know it was a large sum and easily enough to cover the cost of her car and then some. She has a note on her current car. She said she had to pay for college tuition as well, but I believe she was in her last few years at the time and her tuition was under $10k per semester. She didn’t finish college so I don’t know how much she spent on college after her mom’s passing.\n\nShe admitted to me all of the money is gone and I’m just wondering how it happened. I hate to admit it, but I’m judging her pretty hard since she blew through over $300k in a matter of 5 years. We live in a pretty low cost state as well. She attributes it to her being young and not having any parents to help her. It makes me really worried how she might be with large amounts of money. AITA?\n\nTLDR; I (31m) found out my (29f) fiancé spent around $300k over the course of 5 years. She was in college some of the time. Her mother had passed a few years prior to obtaining this money and her father was not in her life. I can’t help to judge her based on this spending, but don’t know if it was justified. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA. It’s not uncommon for people to blow thru life insurance proceeds and inheritances when they are dealing with grief and trauma from a loved one’s death. Throw in that your fiancee was very young when her mom died and it sounds like didn’t have good financial knowledge at that time and it’s even more likely. I highly encourage you to judge less and be curious more."}

I make a little more than 1/3 of our combined income. We are both in our late 30s and we have two 6 yr old boys.

(bride and groom are renting a place.) It is a bit of squeeze but it is working. They have been here for two days now and on the first day I heard them having a whole discussion on how it's so sad that out children won't get to have a \"proper\" childhood with a mom at home, like my husband and his cousin got.

He said that's just their opinion and it's not really hurting me, if I'm bothered I should learn to stick up for myself - and that he can't always do it for me. This sort of struck a nerve because it's true that I usually ask him to do small things like telling the drive-thru person if our order is wrong, because it just makes me feel weird and guilty. But somehow it feels like more his responsibility because it's his family involved here? \n\n  \nAnyways so today my FIL made one more pointed comment during dinner and I said your son makes xxx.

My husband was married before we met. He and his ex-wife separated during her pregnancy with their daughter (13) and divorced after she turned 1.\n\nTo my stepdaughter I am dad's wife. I'm okay with that. We get along fine, mostly. She does struggle to be left with me in charge. My husband knows this. We have discussed this at length. We have worked together to figure out solutions. We even talked with his ex, who is okay with me being around her daughter (I know some aren't) but did not like the idea of her daughter being with me if she could be with her (they don't have a right of first refusal and didn't get it added after this discussion). And generally didn't love that I would be in a parent role if alone with her kid. She has a very big dislike of the idea of stepparents becoming just parents and she has never wanted her daughter to view me as any kind of mother figure. So discussions were had and agreements were made.\n\nOnto our issue: My husband always has a very busy period of work in June/July and he's basically just home to sleep and nothing else. In June his ex is having surgery and will be out of commission and in the hospital for some time. The ex's surgery was not mentioned to me at all. But Saturday night while we were at my ILs house, my husband started venting about his ex's surgery and her not wanting their daughter to be in my care all day and his daughter not wanting to have me in charge of her that much, and how he told them I would be doing it and nothing they said or did would change this.\n\nHe was pissed at his ex and his daughter a little for having such a dislike for me being in charge even though we get along fine. I asked him when all this happened and he said it had been a few days. He told me she would be with \"us\" from June 6th until July 4th and possibly longer. That he was already told he will need to work most Saturdays in June and July. So he told me I'd need to figure out how to best deal with that. I asked him why he sprung this on me in front of his family instead of discussing it privately. He waved me off and said he knew I wouldn't say no because I love my stepdaughter and I understand that she needs to be with an adult. He saw an expression on my face and told me I couldn't be pissed about it when I know my stepdaughter is still a kid. I told him I wasn't pissed at her. I was pissed at him. He told me he can't help his ex and his daughter being somewhat unreasonable. MIL chimed in and offered to take my stepdaughter during the daytime for June. He told her I would handle it, she should be with \"us\". This is when I accused him of treating me like the hired help and not his wife because he wasn't discussing it with me and was making decision for me without asking or discussing things through.\n\nIt was afterward he told me I shouldn't speak to him like that in front of his family.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA.

They let the kids run riot outside our shared area between houses (even though they have their own garden to play in) and the noise drives everyone mad, but I’ve never said anything to avoid arguments. The other day my dog started barking in the garden and when I came out to call her in, I saw her kids provoking her through the fence (poking sticks through the fence at her).

Sometimes neighbours SUCK - one side is wonderful, the other ... smh. Some families seem to think that they should do whatever the hell they want and sod everyone else.\n\nBad news I'm afraid: it took over ten years of multiple neighbours complaining before the community police and local authority stepped in and made bad neighbours and one set of good ones (who understandably reacted as they were REALLY targeted badly) go to mediation. I grey rocked most of the time, so didn't get dragged in beyond having one conversation with police for 'statement'. Since then, things have improved most of the time. EDIT - before anyone asks 'why not move?' - in the UK if  you are a house owner, neighbour disputes legally have to be disclosed as part of the sale, watch your home value crash :/\n\nHold yer hat, here we go:\n\nThe request for a formal email seems a bit bizarre - she possibly wants to show it to her landlord or the council to make a counter complaint about you harassing her, so be VERY careful how you word it. Keep it VERY short, and do not say anything about your feelings, the neighbour doesn't care - focus on what you want them to do/not do:\n\n\"Dear neighbour - I understand that living as part of a community means that we all have to accept noise from each other's children, which is why I have never previously complained since I moved in \\[X date\\] in the interests of good neighbourly relations.\n\nHOWEVER, as requested, I am now writing to you to insist that your children (or any children visiting you) do not tease my dog. We discussed this on \\[X date\\] when I heard my dog barking and discovered that \\[names of children\\] were poking sticks into my garden at the dog, which was making the dog agitated. My dog deserves to be safe in my own garden and I will be installing a camera to ensure that this is the case. I assure you that the camera will only cover my own property. Yours sincerely\"\n\nIf you are in the UK, then cameras that only cover YOUR property do not need to be notified anywhere. If the camera covers any part of the shared area then you will need to put up a notice inside the nearest window or similar just to say 'CCTV recording in operation' - nothing else needed. Check the rules at Information Commissioner's Office website.\n\nAlso, keep a notebook and pen somewhere you can reach it immediately and start documenting EVERYTHING - date, time, what happened, who was present. Your local police force should have a way of recording 101 online - go and fill in that form - fill this in with a \\*very\\* brief history 'there has been excessive noise for years, unfortunately this has recently escalated into neighbour's children displaying ill treatment to my pet dog. When I spoke to the neighbour, they requested I sent a formal email, which I have done - and copy/paste what you sent. There should be a section which asks what action you are looking for or similar - usually, in the first instance, the community police Having A Word.  I used to put 'Unless police believe necessary, I am not requesting direct action with neighbour for now as this may escalate behaviours, please provide a reference number so that repeated incidents can be linked if necessary' - which was dead handy on the couple of occasions where I did have to report directly threatening behaviour.\n\nFINALLY - you already said that you are not the only one unhappy. Time to get friendly/friendlier with the neighbours that you know are also experiencing problems. We had a Whatsapp group. Be SUPER CAREFUL to not put yourselves in the position where counter allegations of bullying might stick. Tempers naturally run high when you can't have peace in your own damn home - I get it.

She never moved in with her boyfriend because they live far from each other and neither of them wanted to compromise. Her baby daddy never ever comes around, he’s seen their son probably less than 30 days total of his entire life. And because of this my sister has been treating me (21f) and my mom as his other parent.

Because she doesn’t want to send him to daycare (she’d be eligible to get free childcare in our state but doesn’t trust it). \n\nAnd I love my nephew to death but these are MY child free, college years; I have been parentified and forced to play mommy for my little siblings for years, and just when they’re getting to the age that they don’t need me so much I don’t think I should be forced to step up and play mommy to another child who isn’t mine.

Jake and Christy broke up when Devon was a baby. They have shared custody 50/50 since. Christy remarried when Devon was 2. Jake and I met when Devon was 2.\n\nI love Devon. Our relationship is good. But I am not his mom. He is not my son. When Jake and I got engaged he referred to Devon as our kid. MIL got so annoyed and said I am not his mom and never will be so Devon is therefore not my kid. I told her that was true, I'm just a bonus in his life and he's going to be my stepson (at that point he wasn't yet my stepson). She told me I should make sure I don't forget my place in his life. Jake told MIL that she had no right to talk to me that way and it wasn't even me who claimed Devon was my kid, it was him claiming he was ours.\n\nAnother time after Jake and I were married I called Devon my stepson. MIL only heard the son part and told me yet again Devon has a mom and I'm not her. I told her I said stepson. She was like oh, good, make sure you remember that.\n\nDevon and I had some trouble for a while. Christy was encouraging him not to be nice to me like he was to his stepdad. So Devon had a period where he was disrespectful and said we're not stepmom/stepson. We did therapy, it helped. We went back to stepmom and stepson. He did make it clear he didn't want me to call him my son. I respect that. I told him I'd always respect those boundaries for him but please let me know if anything does change, so I can make any needed changes and keep us strong.\n\nMIL randomly asked sometime after this if I was back to claiming Devon as mine. Jake told her to stop. He told her she knew I wasn't doing that and she needed to let it go. We spent some time away from her, she apologized, mostly because FIL wasn't interfering like that and saw his grandson and son still.\n\nJake and I have a son together now. Now MIL has flipped a switch because Jake and I have our own son together. She has decided I'm a monster for calling Devon my stepson still and she's now policing me staying stepson instead of son. It's not like it comes up that often but it comes up often enough for her to be bothered by it. If I say I'm here to pick up my stepson instead of son, or say this is my stepson Devon. Jake told her to knock it off and she remembers what happened before with her policing me like this.\n\nMIL dropped by the house to see the baby while my husband was at work. She brought it up to me again. She said now that Devon has a brother we need to stop the step crap and I should be calling both boys my sons. I told her to drop the topic. I did not want this to be a fight again. She ignored me and told me I need to do better. I told her she needs to leave my house if she can't stop policing how I speak, that I would not allow it.

I called my mom to confirm whether we were expecting anything from overseas relatives. When she confirmed we weren't expecting anything, she called the number provided on the packages. They stated they didn't want it and to do whatever I wanted with it and provided no information. The 3 boxes contained misc items like jars of spices and lots of packaged clothes. I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.\n\nIn any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done. If this does happen again then I know what to do. I talked to friends after this happened and they said if they were in their shoes they would also be upset if someone donated their items. Am I the asshole?\n\nedit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives.

His boyfriend comes over a couple times a week for dinner and just to hang out. My brother and his boyfriend have known each other since they were 5, and our families are close family friends. Just for the record, I have NO problem with them dating each other and being gay. Recently my brother has started calling his boyfriend daddy whenever talking to him at dinners and hang outs and such. He says it so often. This makes me uncomfortable, not because they're gay, but because I think it's weird to say in front of other people. I would think it's equally as weird if it were a girl saying it to her boyfriend in front of family. Whatever they call each other alone has nothing to do with me and I don't care. I can tell it makes everyone uncomfortable. So last night at dinner, my brother said it again, and I said \"Hey so I don't care if you call him that when y'all are alone or whatever, but I would appreciate it if you wouldn't say it in front of me anymore\". My brother immediately got mad and started saying that I am homophobic and don't want them to be happy. I said that was ridiculous as I have always been supportive towards his sexuality, and I am very happy that he is in a happy relationship. He got up and went to his room, and his boyfriend followed shortly after. I was very confused because I didn't expect that reaction and I asked my family if anything I said was rude or offensive, and they said it wasn't.

She started nagging non-stop “OMG!! I can’t believe you forgot my burger!!” “Omg! I literally called you on your way there!!” “Omg!! Why did you forget it!!” \n\nSo I screamed out of frustration, “I said I’ll get your burger after I eat!!” Now, I get it I shouldn’t scream and I never do.

I mean I’d be mad too if someone forgot my burger, but the thing is SHE ATE ALREADY and she has her ice cream sundae???

Also English is not my native language, so sorry in advance.\n\nSo, I (30’s F) have (had?) a good friend since college, L (30’s F). We graduated together, and I had a larger group of friends she wasn’t part of (and she had a lot of disagreements with, to which I always tried to make mediate to keep things in peace).\nIn April/2022 I got married and she was one of my bridesmaids,my bachelorette party was ate her house, so she was a very central part of the wedding. Before the party, she ended a bad relationship in January, and started a new one with M (30’s M) in march/22 - I knew him from college, but he wasn’t invited to the wedding because we were not close, but as they were getting serious, I invited him directly to the wedding (not just as her +1).\nThis guy is very good friends with my other friends group, so they began to have more contact and the disagreements got more frequent, to a point that this couple barely showed up to things anymore. So, I always loved this girl but I knew she loved drama, and from my perspective, the beefs were created by her, so I stopped interfering, but I always defended her if they said anything bad about her to me. At the same time, the 2 of us didn’t see each other that much, but we were always in contact through messages, sending random things and “happy birthday” to each other. But the contact was slowly fading.\nNow July of this year, 2 friends from that group ask me if I’m going to her wedding, cause they were invited and presumed I would, and I had no idea she was getting married. I thought she invited them earlier cause they have a baby and may need some arrangements, but that stung. After that, I sent her some messages (unrelated) and she answered shortly, so I got the feeling that I was not going to be invited at all.\nNow, the wedding is next month, I’m pretty sure I’m not going to be invited and I just found out that they invited another couple from that friends group (and her wedding is very small). I then reran all our messages in this 3 years, to see where we fell apart, and I realized that, this year (February/25) I didn’t send her a message on her birthday.\nNow I’m spiraling feeling bad for that, but on the other side, thinking that if this is the reason why she cut me off, that’s kinda disproportional????? But knowing how she blows things out of proportion sometimes, I really think this is her excuse, even though she never called me out for that.\nI know that friendship is gone now, but I have to ask, was I the asshole for forgetting her birthday and is this a proportional response to what I did?

When the day came to an end, my brother had needed to go to the store and my grandmother agreed to take him (he lives seperately).

I would't say the chocolate was a gift. IMO, A gift is something someone decides all on their own they are going to buy you, and then they give it to you. You asked her to buy you the chocolate. To me, that's more like a favor. And she did buy it for you. You couldn't just share a piece with her when she asked? I do think that's selfish. However, if your grandmother really acted the way you said she did, that's a very extreme, rude, a-hole, completely uncalled for reaction. Is you grandmother quick to anger or are you often self absorbed?"}

I’ve noticed over the past year that Emily tends to stretch the truth or flat-out lie about things, both big and small. At first, it was little things like saying she couldn’t come to family dinners because of work, only to post on social media that she was out with friends. Then it escalated to bigger things.\n\nOne example that really bothered me happened recently. We were both supposed to attend a charity fundraiser I was there the entire evening and never saw her. When I later asked if she had made it, she insisted that she had been there the whole time and even said she saw me but was too busy to come say hi. This wasn’t true—I know for a fact she wasn’t there the volenteers list was small and I definitely would have seen her. We were all in the same room.\n\nMore recently, she lied about something involving a family event. We were planning a small gathering for my husband’s birthday, and Emily told me she’d arranged a cake from his favorite bakery. The day of the party, she showed up empty-handed, claiming they “lost the order.” When I called the bakery to see what happened, they had no record of any order ever being placed. \n\nThat was the last straw for me.\n\nI pulled her aside later and confronted her about her constant lying. I tried to be calm and respectful, but I told her that her dishonesty was starting to affect how I viewed her and that it was creating tension in the family. She literally messed up my husband birthday with these lies.  \n\nShe completely denied it and got really upset, saying I was making her out to be a bad person and that I was overreacting. My son got involved and is now angry with me.\n\nThe whole thing has caused a rift, and now Emily refuses to come to any family gatherings unless I apologize.

From what I observed, the girls had a lot of fun together and were all very respectful of each other, my husband, and I. Most of the girls’ parents thanked me and my husband for hosting and said positive things, but one texted me a list of all the things I did wrong.\n\nThe first thing that upset this mom was the fact that my daughter and her friends went swimming in our backyard pool. When the sleepover invites were sent out via text message, I asked the moms if they were okay with their girls going swimming. All of them said “yes” or “that’s okay with me” except for the complaining mom, who simply liked my text. I assumed this meant yes. I would not have allowed this had the girls not been forced to pass a swimming safety unit (which included a swim test at the end) for their PE class. Additionally, my husband completed a lifeguarding course from the Red Cross and passed with flying colors. The mom’s second issue was the food the girls ate, which she deemed unhealthy. I however, did not see an issue with this because I think eating junk at sleepovers is okay. The next issue was the movie the girls watched after dinner. Since some of the girls are 14 and others are 15, we told them no R rated movies, but other than that it was up to them. They ended up choosing The Fault In Our Stars, which the complainer deemed inappropriate. The final thing she was mad about was the fact that the girls didn’t actually go to sleep until midnight. As a mom myself, I understand because I want my daughter to get enough sleep. However, both my husband and I do think that sleepovers are a time when it’s okay to stay up late, provided the kids let the parents sleep (which my daughter and her friends did). Additionally, the girls woke up at 8:30, meaning they got about 8 1/2 hours of sleep. \n\nI received the complaining mom’s text on the day after the sleepover. The text said “Thank you for having my daughter over. It was generous of you to open up your home and graciously host her. However, I feel that many of your decisions were questionable and inappropriate”. She then proceeded to list her objections with specific reasons for each one. I then replied, “Please tell your daughter thanks for coming! She was a pleasure to host. I understand your concerns, but considering that you never communicated your expectations or rules, I don’t think it’s fair to place the blame on me. If we ever do things like this in the future, please make sure to let me know of any restrictions ahead of time. Thank you and have a lovely weekend!” She then responded angrily that it was my fault, and when I texted her to say sorry, she didn’t respond.

Ms Stickupthebutt texting you to complain that a bunch of teenagers went swimming, ate junk food and watched a teen romance movie is ridiculous.

I explain to him that it sometimes works sometimes doesn't and that all of our food has spoiled so we need a repair. He begins asking me electrical questions and to see if certain parts are running.

I thanked her for her apology but said I didn’t forgive her- she said so many awful things to me over 2 missing plates of food.\n\nI said they still weren’t invited to the gathering and that they are welcome to host their own (which I obviously wouldn't attend). This made my brother really mad (they were on speaker together).\n\nA few hours later I got some texts from our mum telling me to just 'get over it' and invite Lucy and John. I just put my foot down and said if they show up, they won't be let in my home.\n\nThe whole situation was caused a rift in the family. Half are telling me I can't not include my brother and the other half are saying Lucy is a bitch for her comments. Lucy and John are still very mad.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA. If Lucy had only been mad at you and commenting on the \"missing\" food, that's one thing. But she was cruel and insulted you personally which is unacceptable. It's nice that she apologized about the food but what about all the abhorrent things she said about you? Her feeling left out and lied to never excuses how she treated you. \n\nYour brother is a major AH for not only lying to you and his wife but letting her continue to treat you that way for months. The only reason he finally confessed is because there was a consequence to him personally. He doesn't give a crap about you. \n\nAnd your mom is a piece of work too. She wants you to get over it? How much did she defend you and lay into her son and his wife over the last year for treating your this way? I'm guessing not at all.\n\nAlso, instead of making up leftover plates, I would just offer that anyone who brought over a dish can take those leftovers. They don't need everything you're providing, especially since your family is so quick to turn on you over something so trivial."}

She pretends I don’t exist & he does nothing to address it. \n\nThe comments on my original post opened my eyes and made me realize that despite this being the healthiest relationship I’ve been in, it doesn’t mean it’s actually healthy. We’ve had a couple conversations surrounding this issue, which mostly consisted of me saying it bothered me & him saying he I was the only one who cared. \n\nA couple things helped me realize my breaking point-\n\n1. I asked him if he would be okay with our daughters future partner treating them like this, to which he got flustered, shut down, and said he didn’t want to talk about it. (I left it alone) \n\n2. He said he didn’t want to end his friendship or do anything to jeopardize it because “what if we break up.” This made me realize he would not protect me as his wife, since he didn’t as his girlfriend. \n\nThe final straw was when I expressed how much it bothered me that he wanted me to blow this off since we, as in me & the best friend, only see each other 4-6 times a year & he said (directly quoted because this is burned into my brain) : “I know the way she treats you is garbage, but you’re allowing one person to dictate our relationship.” \n\n“It could be worse. She could be more active. There are worse ways to meddle, people text and lie, and all that to break relationships up.”\n\nThe first line broke my heart and told me all I needed to know. I have to truck through a couple more months of pre-planned & paid for  social engagements, but I closed the curtain on any chance of healing this relationship the moment those words left his mouth. \n\nThank you everyone for the advice, common sense, knocking me upside my head, and similar related experiences & outcomes. \n\nI’m gonna go to therapy & redefine what a healthy, balanced, and communicative relationship. \n\nEDIT: the preplanned events aren’t the wedding/ engagement related. We share a home, need to divide assets, pets, a custody schedule. Additionally we have vacations, planned with a mutually shared friend group (bf not part of that group). I appreciate the concerns but I need to plan things out a little more. There will be no second chance. \n\nTo those that keep saying they’re fucking- probably . When I first brought this up, he became stressed & kept emphasizing how I thought he was fuckin his best friend, and didn’t address the issue that was brought up. I don’t care to know or confirm. \n\nEDIT 2: We are NOT getting married, continuing our relationship. For those thinking I’m using the preplanned events to justify holding out good- absolutely f*ckin not. Our relationship was dead the moment he admitted she treated my like garbage, and basically shrugged it off. \n\nAs a note- I NEVER asked him to cut anyone off, out of his life. I simply asked for basic greetings & acknowledgment during the rare encounters with his BFF.  This hasn’t happened, aside from a couple of begrudging times \n\nFINAL EDIT: I tried asking him the “what would you tell your daughter to do” question. He answered that if she loved her partner, she shouldn’t care about outside ppl. Additionally he  said he was tired of talking about it, he feels he’s done all he can, and he doesn’t want us(me) to bring her up because he’s tired of talking about it.  I told him our relationship is done I  September (when our lease is up etc), apologized for bringing it up, and asked if he wanted to be alone for the evening.\n\nThank you everyone for helping me realize I wasn’t asking for to much. I really thought he was the one for me, but I wasn’t thinking straight. I’m tired & I want better for myself. I’m ok with being alone. \n\nI appreciate you all. Have a good night", "assistant": "NTA do not marry. One day you will look back and laugh at the idea."}

We talk once or twice a year. I would take a bullet for her even though she hates my guts.\n\nRecently, she started dating someone. When they started dating, she lost contact with my parents and didn’t even come home to visit family at Christmas the whole month (she lives 30 mins away from my parents). She wouldn’t introduce her new partner to anyone in our family for nearly a year of them dating. Myself, having been in an abusive relationship in the past, I saw that as a huge red flag.\n\nI kept an eye on her social media from afar and checked in to ask my parents about her often, but she stopped talking to them mostly too. (Unless she needed money). 6 months after her no-show at Christmas, I started getting calls from her, late at night, asking for money. This happened 3 times. When I asked what was wrong she said she needed an uber home from her bfs because they were in a disagreement. She said she didn’t want to talk about it, so I didn’t push further, even though it had me wondering why she would need money to get home from his place when he has a car or she could just stay there. How bad were these fights?\n\nThe third time, when I picked up the phone, she was crying. She sounded out of breath and she coughed a little and sniffled from how much she had been crying. She told me she had to get out of her bf’s house right away and she had no money for an Uber home or to and from work the next couple of days. I spoke to her for a bit and ended up sending her $200 with a promise she would pay me back when she could. I asked her to call me when she got home so I knew she was okay.\n\nShe didn’t call but I got a text with a promise to call on her way to work. Morning rolled around, and then noon, and I hadn’t heard from her. I called her and it would go straight to voicemail. Eventually, I got a reply that just said “I’m working,” and left it at that.\n\nI felt bad for the rough night she had. I live 3 hours away, but my BFF lives close to her work, so I sent my BFF on a mission to drop off some lunch for my sister to brighten up her day a little. My BFF pulled up at her work, and was told that my sister called in and wasn’t going to work that day. When I heard this, I got worried and tried to call again, but it was going straight to voicemail.\n\nThis might be where I screwed up. I called the cops to do a wellness check. I didn’t want to call my parents at the risk that she would come around the house even less if my folks knew she was fighting with her bf. So, I decided to deal with it myself and spare any relationship she had left with my folks.\n\nThe officers called her and didn’t get an answer, so I told them her address and expected them to stop at her house and check to see if she was there. Instead, the officer went into her work and started asking questions about my sister’s bf and her before checking her house.\n\nShe was understandably livid, and she hasn’t spoke to me since. It’s been months. AITAH?", "assistant": "NTA, in my early 20s I was in an abusive relationship, someone I loved called a wellness check on me and I was livid. Later another person I loved called a wellness check that saved my life.\n\nDoing the right thing is brave, thankless and painful. It also saves people’s lives."}

My sister organized this cruise with her boyfriends family and invited my parents to join. Then after they all made their cruise plans and decided what time/destination/price was best for them, she invited me and some of our other extended family, thinking the more the merrier. I spent a lot of time thinking this through and deciding if I could go or not, and ultimately I decided I'm not able to comfortably afford this trip-- The cruise is on school vacation week, it's a full week long, it leaves from Miami so flights are insane, and it's just not in my budget right now. Not to mention I am the only single person in the entire group, which meant I would have to pay for both spots in my room, so it's twice as expensive for me. And, a cruise would not ever be my first choice on how to spend my money, a full week at sea does not appeal to me at all-- the only reason I would have considered it is because it breaks my heart to miss out of a family trip, something we haven’t done since 2006. This trip has unfortunately turned into a full family vacation that was just not planned with me in mind, and I can't make it work. When I told my parents I couldn't go, they then offered to pay for my room, which at that point felt like an afterthought and like pity so I declined-- especially where they weren't paying for my little sisters room.\n\nI have been really sad and frustrated about the entire situation, but I've accepted that the trip wasn't planned for me and I can join in on the next one hopefully. \n\nFast forward to today where my parents asked me to drive 3.5 hours home to stay with their dogs for the week while they go on this trip. This stings! I know I was invited and I am choosing not to go, but the idea of sitting home with their dogs while they all enjoy a vacation feels so bad. \n\n1. Am I the asshole for not going on this trip? \n2. Am I the asshole for telling them I can't come home to watch their dogs while they go on a family vacation that I can't afford to go on?", "assistant": "YTA\n\nIt's more likely your parents offered to pay for your room because they love you and wanted you there, not some ego-slighting pity.\n\nIt's fine if you just didn't like the idea of a cruise, but to be so upset over everyone going when you had multiple chances to join in, and resenting them for asking for your help since you made it clear you weren't interested in going, is just poor form."}

Drew supports Susanne on his income while she focuses on her dream of being an artist. She makes paintings of people and animals, and has a website where she advertises her work for sale.\r  \n\r  \nPrivately, I don’t think her art is very good. It’s absolutely better than what I could do, but it doesn’t look “professional,” if you know what I mean. My husband feels the same, so we have not opted to purchase any of her art, despite her dropping hints here and there about it.\r  \n\r  \nThe art on her site is priced in the $3-5K range. I realize that labor and cost of materials must be taken into account, but given the quality, those prices seem outrageous to me. I suspect she’s not making regular sales, because she started making portraits of friends, family, or pets “as a surprise,” and usually, said family and friends end up feeling obligated to buy the painting as a courtesy. Unfortunately, my husband and I were the latest victims of this sales tactic.\r  \n\r  \nMy son recently proposed to his girlfriend, and we took the two of them, his girlfriend's parents, and our daughter out to a fancy dinner to celebrate. Both my kids posted pictures from dinner on social media. Without telling anyone, Susanne decided to make a painting of one of these pictures, of everyone smiling for the camera. She revealed the big “surprise” at a party she and Drew hosted two weeks ago. The painting is a whopping 40x58”, and I honestly think it’s awful... kitsch and tacky.\r  \n\r  \nI told Susanne it was sweet of her to commemorate such a special moment in our family, but I carefully avoided saying anything about “liking” it. As I feared, she kept dropping hints throughout the party about how we can buy it as a wedding gift, and she would be happy to give us a big discount off what she would charge someone else. (Who else would buy it?)

He said it’s becoming obvious as the years go by that we’ve never purchased one of her pieces, even though we have the means to do so, and it would mean a lot to them if we buy the painting. Her original asking price was $2.5K, and Drew said he’ll reduce it further to $1900.\r  \n\r  \nIt's not about the money (not entirely.) It’s the principle of the thing. I feel like I’m being strongarmed into paying for something I never asked for, don’t like, and don’t have space for in my house. I asked, and my son and his fiancée don’t want it. My husband thinks we should just buy it to keep the peace in the family and avoid a potential rift with Susanne and Drew. He also says the way I talk makes me sound like a snob (even though I would never share these opinions with anyone I know but him.)

We have two boys, a 5yr old and a 7yr old. My husband works in an office and he has the option to work a few days a week from home, but he prefers not to because he says it's easier to focus in the office. I run a small business from home. I don't have a lot of daily work, just some emails and planning (maybe 3 hours a day?)  but the business does make about a third of our household income. But my younger son is home all day and just dealing with him takes a lot of energy. He's really high energy and will probably wreck something if you leave him alone for an hour. And then the older one comes home at 3 and both of them are with me until 8 or 9, which is when my husband usually comes home. A few days ago, I was really tired and I didn't make dinner. When my husband came home I asked him if we could just order something. He was also tired and we were both short tempered so we ended up snapping at each other. \n\nHe said I should have at least ordered before he got home and he was hungry, I said I forgot and it's not fair that food is always my problem. He said that I'm home all day and I even admit I don't have much work to do, so I'm basically a SAHM and should at least take care of dinner. I said he has no idea how much I do everyday, and he said he'd handle the kids for an entire day while also working from home just to prove it should be easy for me. I said sure, so he made the arrangements to work from home yesterday. \n\n  \nI slept in, and when I woke up he was already frazzled from getting the older one ready for school. He ended up having to cancel a meeting to make breakfast, and was worried about that. Then when he took another meeting later on, the boys went out to play in the yard and got super muddy and left footprints all over the house. which he then had to mop, and I didn't help at all. By this point I did feel sort of guilty because it was definitely harder for him to take care of work at the same time, but all I wanted was an apology. He said he was doing this to show that I do nothing all day, and if he just admitted he was wrong I would have helped out straight away. \n\nLater on he had another meeting, and he told the boys not to bother him for an hour. But about 20 mins in, they got in an argument about something and our younger one went into my husband's room to complain. He was really loud and my husband's video was also on, then he told the kid to leave him alone but he was upset and crying and wasn't listening. After a few mins my husband went back to the meeting and apologized to the other people. when it was finished, he was really angry at me. he said I could see what was happening and I just watched him struggle without helping. I said all you had to say was please help, he said I shouldn't be so petty and prideful. This probably made him look a bit stupid in front of his manager, but it was only a few minutes and I don't think It was the huge deal he made it out to be.", "assistant": "NTA.

She dropped us off, and we went our separate ways. \n\nAfter we arrived at the bank our appointment was cancelled last minute, and we ended up catching the bus to the bookstore earlier than expected, around 45 mins after getting there, my dad called and asked why I was spending money at the store (he has a history of being angry at me for my shopping habits even though I am financially independent) I explained I was returning something, and we were getting coffee.  \n\nHe proceeded to accuse me of not saying what bank we were going to, and that I purposefully didn’t to manipulate his wife into driving us farther than she’d be willing to go, which wasn’t my intention. I explained this, and said I would apologize as I wasn’t trying to mislead her, but he wouldn’t accept that. He insisted I admit to being manipulative so I could spend money and that I knew I was making her go to that side of town even though she normally doesn’t travel that far from home. He also said I “know their schedules and should be aware of and plan for what times they do things”\n\nI told him that his problems may be big to him, but they are insignificant to the people around him, and that if she wasn’t able to we could have easily caught the bus, but she never said no. \n\nNow he’s very angry with me and says he’s not going to give us rides anymore, I said that’s fine, because I have an electric scooter and we are perfectly able to catch the bus.

This morning as I was starting to load the washer I had to turn every one of my sons socks as they were all inside out.\n\n I made a comment about how I hate flipping the socks around and told my husband to please talk to him when he gets home from school since he has been asked by myself multiple times to stop putting them in the laundry inside out and he hasn’t listened to me.\n\nMy husband (49M), who has been inconsistent with discipline, thinks I’m overreacting. He believes it’s my responsibility to keep the house in order since I’m at home. However, I feel that kids need to learn how to take care of themselves and contribute to household chores. \n\nOur 14 year old son is responsible for taking out the trash, cleaning his bathroom and bedroom and occasionally vacuuming the living room if I need help as I have an autoimmune disease which can leave me unable to do much when I’m having a flare up.

Despite this, my husband doesn’t consistently back me up on discipline or enforcing rules. He thinks I should be grateful I’m able to be at home and able to take care of the family’s needs and shouldn’t complain about anything since I don’t have to work anymore. \n\n\nSo, AITA for expecting my son to put his socks right side out before tossing them in the laundry basket?", "assistant": "YTA\n\nLook, you're not wrong that the kids need to learn to pull their weight and do chores.

Does not work, avoids court appearances, lives with his mother, does not even have a state ID. \n\nI have been support my sister for 3 years, she was staying with our mom but something happened to her and she now lives in a retirement community so she does not have the same amount of space. \n\nMy mom asked me to make sure my sister is okay she is the baby. I get it she was young and the father of her child played a good act. I do not blame her for that.\n\nSo I cover childcare, and rent for my sister. I will spot her when she needs other stuff like school supplies, food, clothes for my niece. She is a manager at Target. \n\nWhen she has to work late I will let my niece sleepover.

I’m a very short woman, 4’9 and under 100lbs. I don’t want to complain about being small, but there are a lot of people out there (esp. other women) who will not take us seriously, are judgmental, make snide comments, assume attraction to us is nefarious, etc. A lot of comments that imply we’re not real women etc.\n\nI’m used to it and usually let it roll off my back. But there’s a new one that’s picked up momentum that I guess stems from a TV show where a girl is putting on a childish act and she says “I’m a very sexy baby” in a cutesy voice and there’s a LOT more to it that you can just Google.\n\nMy SIL Cassie has picked this up and has been using this “against me.” I can’t wear a cute outfit without her coming down on me and chiding me for “buying into the whole sexy baby thing” when I am JUST WEARING AN OUTFIT. I’m just trying to be ME. God forbid I wear a shorter skirt or bows or anything I think is cute.\n\nIt’s like I’m not allowed to wear cute or sexy things because I’m petite so I’m automatically seen as trying to be a “sexy baby” when I’m not. I’ve asked Cassie to stop or drop it and she maintains that I’m the one opening myself up to judgment and I should dress my age.\n\nThis came to a head last weekend when we were in my auntie’s backyard at the pool. I took off my wrap so I could hang with my feet in the pool with my cousins and Cassie immediately said “You’re a very sexy baby” at me and twirled imaginary pigtails.\n\nI raised my voice and said “That’s a really weird thing to keep saying. What is your problem with me? Why do you keep bringing up that I’m small?”\n\nShe started to turn red and she yelled back again that I’m the one that’s choosing to walk around looking like the “sexy baby.”\n\nI said that I’m literally just wearing a bathing suit (a one piece halter) and asked her what I should be wearing instead if that’s such a problem.\n\nShe yelled back that I should “dress like a grown adult” and to stop trying to cause a scene in front of everyone. I said whatever and just tried to ignore her.\n\nLater on we ended up inside at the same time and she came down on me for calling her out in front of everyone. I told her to stop trying to make me feel bad for being small, that I didn’t choose this body. She rolled her eyes and told me to grow the fuck up, and that “trying to start shit” with her is even more proof.\n\nI am at a loss here and I’m starting to just not want to be around my family because of her.

He warned me that he usually doesn’t wear his HAs at home so communication might be harder, but promised to make adjustments until I get better at signing.\n\nA month ago, we finally moved in together. Unfortunately things were harder than I imagined it would be.  When he said he doesn’t usually wear them at home, I assumed he would take them off before going to bed or so.  But he takes them off as soon as he’s back from work.\n\nYou can see where this is going. Because my ASL isn’t there yet I have to constantly write things down, and let me tell you it is not fun. It doesn’t feel like actual communication. He doesn’t like it either, he says I should always attempt to sign first, look it up if I have to, and writing down should be my last choice. This strict teacher attitude also drives me nuts.\n\nYesterday I was telling him something via signing then realized I couldn’t and didn’t feel like writing either so I told him to forget about it. He got upset at me for giving up and told me to at the least write it down. \n\nI was put off by his demanding attitude, I wrote, “maybe if you wore your fucking hearing aids, this wouldn’t be an issue.” He put them on and we started arguing.

Three years ago Cheryl pulled me (15m) aside and told me about the affair and that she wanted my help to make my siblings still love her when they found out. She was someone we were all close with. I'm the baby of the family and the \"favorite\" of everyone, which I don't see as true, but it's a bit of a joke and I am the baby so I do get people looking out for me more. This is something Cheryl tried to use to her advantage. She put me in the worst position by telling me about the affair because she hoped my siblings would love me too much to hate her if I told them not to. I was so angry at her and at dad. I didn't want to be the one to tell mom. I didn't want to see her break down. But I knew I needed to. Mom was furious, more at Cheryl for involving me than the affair at first. My dad defended Cheryl and said she had known me my whole life and should be allowed to confide in me. It turned into a really big fight. My siblings hated them more for trying to involve me too.\n\nDuring the divorce we all said we wanted to stay with mom. The judge ruled I had to go to my dad's until I was 14.

Dad's family have tried to reach out and get me to reconcile but I told them it would not happen and I hate my dad.\n\nCheryl confronted me while I was at the mall the other day. She followed me into different stores and said I have two younger siblings I should know and that I loved her before so I should stop punishing her and dad and start being more respectful. I had enough when I realized she wasn't going to walk away and I told her she's disgusting and repulsive for trying to use me to her advantage, a 12 year old kid, when she was having an affair with dad.

It is newer and smoother, and the console is higher.\n\nSo on that day, I was doing my 5’ on/1’ off intervals on the middle treadmill when these two people got in front of the treadmill to get my attention. I thought it was an urgent matter, so I took one headphone out, but they just asked if I could move to one of the side treadmills. They said they wanted to run next to each other and asked if I could move to one of the treadmills on the side. I said no and put my headphone back in. I thought that would be the end, but they stayed in front of me, waving in front of me and nagging (I couldn’t hear their exact words through my headphones). When I got to my rest period, I asked what was up. They asked why I wouldn’t move and I said “I’m doing intervals.” They looked at me confused and said I could just move and it would take like five seconds. I told them if they wanted this treadmill they should have gotten here before I did, and to stop bothering me.\n\nI didn’t have the necessary breath to explain this, but since I was doing very strict interval training that was programmed, I couldn’t interrupt it. Also, it would just throw off my vibe. Also, the middle treadmill is my favorite, and I was there first. When I got to the lobby, one of the girls was waiting for me. She told me I was very rude and that I should be banned from the gym for my conduct. I was like, “Girl, it’s a treadmill. It’s not that deep.” She said I was lucky she didn’t film me and get me in a Joey Swoll video (mind you, I’m a girl, too). At this point, of the guys working the front desk came up and asked if she was bothering me (she was getting very heated and I was staying calm). I said yes. He told her to leave me alone or he would call security. The girl begrudgingly left.\n\nWhen I retold this story to my friends, all my running friends were fully with me. One of them was like, “interrupting someone’s workout should be a felony.” Some of my non-running friends, however, were a bit on the fence. Some of them think it was rude that I didn’t give an explanation (I was out of breath because I was doing intervals). One of my friends also brought up a point that while I’m a runner and I use the gym for sport-specific training, most other residents probably use that gym more casually, and it’s not fair for me to expect them to meet the same gym standards and I should have just moved, or at least explained. Was I an AH for not moving?", "assistant": "NTA it doesn’t matter if it is a gym or coffee shop table or airplane seats, if two people want to be side by side they need to plan for it, that may mean arrive early or go at an off peak time or purchase two seats together. “No” or perhaps “Sorry no” used to be acceptable answers but many people have found that if they bug you enough, you give in just to avoid the hassle. If the middle treadmill is the better one, perhaps suggest to management that they move it to one side because I am sure you are not the only one who prefers it and your situation probably happens other times too."}

I understand that she felt like her boundaries were being disrespected, but her severity on this matter made coexisting with her very difficult, and because I was renting a room from her, and she owned the house, there was ultimately an imbalanced power dynamic bc it was ultimately her say, and it left me feeling powerless and dismissed.\n\nBasically, I'm wanting to know am I in the wrong here? I would /try/ to respect her wishes, but ultimately I failed. I feel like she was too severe, and too controlling, and should have been more willing to be open to compromise. Or maybe I'm fully the asshole bc I couldn't respect this boundary of hers? Please help me see things clearly.\n\n\n\nEDIT: ppl are asking for more specificity, my bad. Rides was a big one, I'm legally blind and she used to be more willing to give me rides, but then stopped having the capacity to, which was hard for me to get used to and I would try to problem solve by offering alternative solutions. \n\nHousehold things came up a lot, like I didn't like her leaving stinky bags of dirty litter in the kitchen bc she didn't have the energy to take them to the trash outside. I would ask her to either not use open paper bags-using plastic tie-able ones to help with the smell, or keep them in her bathroom until she had the energy to take them out. \n\nOne time I had tried to get her for 3 months to buy more floor cleaner (it was her agreed responsibility, mine was to provide trash bags) but she wouldn't do it bc she wanted a specific out of stock brand. \n\nAnother issue was asking her to replace my mail key that she took from me when she lost hers, and then wouldn't replace it.\n\nOther examples, some were like me wanting to put a decoration or like christmas tree somewhere, or move my litter box to a different part of the house, which like yeah its her house, her say, but I would try to find a compromising place that we could both be ok with. \n\nA lot of 'no's' came down to like small things, trying to make plans or little asks,, so its hard to remember a lot of examples. It just felt very difficult living with someone who was constantly saying no, and not willing to be open to compromise.

Thankfully my family is helping me with my daughter financially and im also working. \nDuring my pregnancy i met someone, let’s call him Steve (29M). his sweet, a hard worker, so respectful and his been through the pregnancy and postpartum with me, without him I would’ve been a reck. He made my pregnancy so peaceful. \n\nA few months ago our relationship hit a rock, he woke up and broke up with me and i was obviously heartbroken and i confide in my mother about what happened and she told me that it’s been 3 weeks since she’s been home(she doesn’t live with us) and i haven’t gone to visit him once (i saw him a month before we broke up: she didn’t know that) and in her words she said if she was him, she would cheat too because i never make time for him/visit him, that statement is the light version to avoid making this post long. She even told her friends about my breakup and the advice she gave me. \n\nFast forward to now 3 months later … i decided to give Steve another chance and his been consistent with working on the cracks in our relationship, so we made plans to have a weekend to ourselves even though his going to be taking me to work in the mornings and picking me up in the afternoon when i knock off and we spend time together after work so i tell my mom only so she knows where i’ll be during the weekend and also to ask if I should leave my daughter with our live in nanny or take her to my grandparents \nmy mom says “i shouldn’t do sleepovers at a boyfriend’s place” and i remind her she said to me if i don’t spend time with him/visit him he will cheat, my mom got mad and said im a disrespectful child and i don’t value her and she’s never giving me advice again and so AITA?? \n\nEdit: i want to clarify something things \n\nMy mom only helps financially, she doesn’t live with us, but visits and I work too hence we have a nanny, and this will be the first time I will be away from my daughter since she has been born in April of 2023. \n\nSteve and I have been doing day dates and trips and such working around the fact that my daughter is young but now she is almost 2, this will be the first sleepover because like i said in my comment down below, we live 1hr and 30 mins apart now that i moved back home(it’s more convenient so i can save up). \nFor additional context to my relationship with mom, yeah we actually do have one, and I am used to that, i don’t normally confide in her so i don’t normally have to take her advice… this was the first time due to the fact that she walked in on me, so yeah there’s that, I did apologise to her though", "assistant": "ESH.

Our wedding isn’t going to be super extravagant, as we only wanted to celebrate with our friends and family. A lot of the things for our wedding are going to be simple, DIY, with the help of our friends/family, etc. The main thing we absolutely wanted was our wedding venue. We instantly knew it was the one and we wanted a specific date ( our 3 year first date anniversary). Unfortunately, our venue told us this date was not available and so we chose a date a few weeks after. It was around this time that we announced our wedding party.\n\nFlash forward to about 2 weeks ago when we got a call from our venue saying that the date we originally wanted had opened up. We were thrilled so we moved our wedding back. We didn’t have any reservations about doing this because everyone who was coming to the wedding is relatively local and hadn’t made any travel accommodations yet. We told our guests about the change and everyone was fine until I got a call from my best friend and maid of honor. \n\nShe said that the wedding was now her birthday (which I obviously knew) and that her and her boyfriend were going to go on a trip that week. I was shocked as I hadn’t heard of these plans before, but I just told her that I really wanted her to be at my wedding because she is my best friend in the world. She told me it was unfortunate that the wedding date moved, but that her trip was already paid for and mostly non-refundable. I was crying at this point, and just said how this is unfair and how upset I am. She said I didn’t have a reason to be this upset because I moved the date without telling anyone and someone was bound to not be able to go  anymore.

My two older sisters are 44 and 47, and my four younger sisters are 38, 36, 34, and 32. We’ve always been a close-knit family, and for the past decade, I’ve taken on the responsibility of hosting Thanksgiving at my house. I enjoy having everyone over, but it’s a lot of work, especially since we all have at least 2 kids each (all in the age group 5-15). It’s chaos, but joyful chaos. My husband helps out, but the majority of the planning, cooking, and organizing falls on me.\n\nThis year, I decided I need a break. Life has been hectic, and I’m feeling burnt out. Between work, taking care of my kids(10,11M), and other responsibilities, I’m just not up for the task of hosting a big family gathering. So, I suggested that one of my sisters take over hosting Thanksgiving this year.\n\nI brought this up in our family group chat, thinking it would be a reasonable request and it’s plenty ahead of time. However, my two older sisters, Sarah (47) and Emily (44), were not happy with the idea. Sarah has a busy job and a smaller house, so she feels she can’t accommodate everyone comfortably. Emily argued that she’s been dealing with a lot of stress lately and doesn’t have the energy to host. They both suggested that since I’ve been doing it for so long, I should just keep the tradition going, especially since my house is the most spacious and I’m the one who “knows how to do it right.”\n\nMy younger sisters were more understanding, but they also hesitated to take on the responsibility. My sister Jessica (38) said she would be willing to help out more with the preparations if I hosted, but she wasn’t confident about hosting the entire event herself. The other younger sisters offered similar compromises, but no one was willing to take on the full load.\n\nAfter some back and forth, I stood firm and said I really need someone else to host this year. I suggested we could even make it a potluck to ease the burden, but Sarah and Emily were still upset. They accused me of being selfish and abandoning a family tradition that I’ve upheld for years. They argued that I’m the one with the most experience, and that Thanksgiving just wouldn’t be the same if I didn’t host. Now, there’s tension in the family, with my older sisters feeling like I’m letting them down.\n\n\nI feel like I’ve done my fair share over the years, and it’s not unreasonable to ask for a break. But at the same time, I understand that my older sisters are also under a lot of pressure, and that hosting Thanksgiving is a big deal for our family.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to host Thanksgiving this year after doing it for the past decade?\n\n*ETA* The second oldest, Emily, handles Christmas. So I feel like it’s totally fair that she not want to do both. (She does not cook though, she hires a catering company, but it’s still a lot to take on regardless) \n\n**UPDATE**\nSo the sisters and I got together on Friday night and had a good talk (I may or not have had a mini breakdown on them). On Saturday, Emily called the company that she uses for Catering at Christmas, and they are going to do Thanksgiving for us!!! Still happenening at my house but they are like FULL SERVICE catering too, they come and set everything up, are there for the service of the food and then they take everything down. Sarah, Emily and I are going to split the cost and since I normally dont split Christmas costs with them (because I did Thanksgiving) I will now split Christmas costs with them. This will be how we proceed moving forward. I cannot tell you all how much I appreciate the helpful comments and support! I feel like such a weight has been lifted. \nI know some are going to comment about the younger sisters and why they dont contribute to the costs. The answer there is pretty simple, they are less established in their careers/or are single income households due to stay at home parenting. They help in a lot of other ways in day-to-day life and we three older sisters really dont mind paying the bill for the holidays.", "assistant": "NTA. Thanksgiving is a lot of work.

One of her stipulations was that we have Life360 together if I was staying in her house, to which I agreed. \n\nWell, I occasionally visit my younger cousins on my dad’s side (they’re 11 and 6) and teach them Volleyball. This is very rare, usually once every few months. My mom doesn’t have a good relationship with anyone in my dads family and for a while I didn’t either but have slowly gotten into better terms with my uncle, thus allowing for a relationship with my cousins.\n\nEarlier this week I had lunch with a friend for her birthday, during which I received a text from my uncle asking if I’d like to come visit my uncles. I agreed and went over after lunch. I didn’t tell my mom the addition of plans because I knew she’d have a negative reaction. \n\nWhen I got home, she was ignoring me and wouldn’t acknowledge any of my attempts at conversation. When I asked why, she flew off the handle and asked me why I’m always “f**king lying” about where I go and that she doesn’t care if I go over to my dads side of the family’s house and that she doesn’t “give a damn about them”. She continued to insist that I never went to lunch with my friend at all and the whole thing was an elaborate lie to be able to go to my uncles house.\n\nI got super frustrated and told her that I wasn’t lying, I just added plans and didn’t tell her because I’m an adult. She then said that I live in her house and she can see my location so I had to have known she’d find out so therefore it was technically a lie. \n\nAt that point I walked away and hid in my room but then she went to my brother to complain and continue calling me a liar. After that, the only communication we have is her making digs at me. For example, our dog was barking and being generally unruly and she said “that’s probably something OP taught him”.

For background, hubby (33M) and I (38F) and our 4 kids (14M, 12M, 10F, and 9 months F) live with MIL. Several other family members live here as well. To state from the jump, we are not freeloaders. The current arrangement is we pay half the mortgage and all of the household bills. MIL pays the rest out of the rent paid by other household members. We don't live here because we are broke or need someone to take care of us. We have simply had a lot of roadblocks to owning our own home stemming from his prior divorce and his ex wife wrecking his almost perfect (at the time) credit. Also notable is that we have spent several thousands of dollars of savings meant for our own home on maintenance and repairs on MIL's house. We also (obviously) provide all food, clothing, toiletries, etc that the kids need. \n\nNow to my complaint. Since the birth of our baby (my first child), I have been a SAHM, as the job I had at the time would not have covered day care. As it's summer break, the kids are home every day as well, and ahead of every shopping trip, I ask them what simple breakfast and lunch options they want me to pick up for the week. I do this to give them options I know they will eat and that they can assemble for themselves. I cook dinner for us all every night, but for breakfasts and lunches they can make their own choices. They are all capable of making sandwiches, using a microwave, and my 14 year old can do simple things like fry eggs on the stove. I feel they need to learn this independence and it lightens my load because the baby takes a lot of attention. \n\nThe problem I am running into is that apropo of nothing, without asking me the kids what our plans are, if they are hungry, if they want what she is making, MIL will just cook something, plate it, and hand it to the kids wherever they happen to be. Rest assured, I know what my kids eat and when, I keep them on a pretty consistent schedule, same as I do with the baby. So what she is doing I feel like it undermines me in as much that it seems like she thinks I don't make sure they eat. She is also taking away their choices of the food they specifically asked for, and also is reinforcing them being lazy (which is also a thing she complains about) by not at least asking them to get up and plate their own. She also gets angry if they don't eat what she gives them. I have talked to hubs about it and he says \"she just wants to feel useful.\" I just feel there are so many other ways she could be useful without undermining my parenting choices. I realize this is a cultural thing (his family is Hispanic) but I also feel like that doesn't entitle someone to cross boundaries. I could make 800 posts on other things she and I butt heads on, but this is just the current thing that is really bugging me. AITA\n\nEdit: Just so I don't have to keep explaining this in each comment, I'm not \"new.\" Hubby and I have been together 6 years, living together almost as long, and the kids have lived full time with us for 4 years. Shortly after they moved in, their mom went radio silent for about a year and a half, so yeah, I have been involved and raising them even when she wasn't. I do food shops, clothing shops, back to school shops. I schedule and take them to doctors and dentists. I pick them up from school/take care of them when they are sick. I fix boo boos when they happen. Help with homework. Talk to them/talk their teachers when they experience bullying at school.  All the basic stuff a mom does. So when I call them my kids, it's because they are. My MIL doesn't do any of that stuff. She is not raising anyone. She pops in when and where she pleases and tries to take credit for doing some kind of heavy lifting. Often she just makes more problems that I end up having to deal with. I pointed out in one comment that she has no problem giving our older daughter sweets/soda/etc without consulting any parent, but is never the one fighting with her to make sure her teeth are brushed.

I love all my cousins dearly and I see them more as siblings than cousins. Two years ago, one of my female cousins (26) got engaged to her long time partner. I thought he was a nice guy. I never really formed a bond with him, but he was nice. The wedding was an over the top event, with celebrations spanning over three days. Too much for my own taste, but my cousin seemed happy, so I was happy.\nLast month, my cousin called me quite late at night. She said she needed a place to stay for a while. She wasn’t crying, she was just sad. I told her she could obviously stay at my place, no questions asked. She arrived at my house about 40 mins later with nothing but a shoulder bag. She told me she wants to divorce her husband because of some serious issues going on between them, but my aunt (her mom) wouldn’t allow it. In my culture, divorce is heavily frowned upon, especially coming from the woman. I told her me and my girlfriend would support her 100%. We would be by her side every step of the way and she can live in our house for as long as she needs. It is not a big house by any means, but there’s always room for family.\nThe next morning, my aunt called me and demanded to speak to my cousin. I politely declined to let her speak to her daughter, but she insisted. When I declined, she showed up at my door with her husband. I called the police and they removed my aunt and uncle from my porch. Now, my aunt is blowing up my phone, accusing me of enabling my cousin’s disrespectful behaviour and saying I shouldn’t support her decision to break up her family. Regardless of what I say, my aunt won’t stop calling and showing up at my house, and it’s been almost a month of this non stop circus. My cousin, my girlfriend and I are sick of it. My uncle even told the rest of the family that I’m holding her daughter captive and I’m filling her head with divorce ideas. My family refuses to get involved in any way.\nSo I’m asking you guys, AITA for standing by this girl?", "assistant": "NTA go to police for harrassment cause your aunt&uncle are harrassing you!

While my mom financially provided for my sister and myself, she was emotionally hands off. She came to a ballet recital here and there but didn’t want to help with homework, didn’t want to listen when we needed advice, etc. Our dad did 95% of the emotional labor. I later found out from my mom that my dad was the one who wanted kids. She loved her career and didn’t mind providing financially but she did not want to do any of the stuff related to raising us outside of that. I am very grateful she provided for us financially, but I do admit it hurts that she wasn’t there when we needed her. She was physically present but not emotionally present.\n\nEDIT: as this has come up, to be clear, the arrangement was my mother’s idea, not my father’s. That being said, I do agree that my father was equally as selfish for making this arrangement. \n\nMy dad always did grand gestures for her. Mother’s Day was always a big deal with a huge brunch, flowers, gifts. She was spoiled. She did nothing for him on Father’s Day. He had to do everything for himself until my sister and I were old enough to do stuff for him. I get that was the arrangement they had but I know it made my dad sad. I once asked why he didn’t get the same hoopla our mom got and he just sadly said “father’s day isn’t as important as Mother’s Day.”\n\nAs adults, my sister and I have tried to rectify it. We do Father’s Day up big and our dad loves it. We grill for him just how he taught us and throw a huge BBQ with some other family members. However, we’ve turned Mother’s Day very lowkey. We still celebrate our mom but she usually gets a quiet lunch at a restaurant of her choice and a few gifts. After my mom ended up skipping my sister’s baby shower this year because “she didn’t see the big deal with someone having a baby”, my sister wanted to do nothing for her. We sent gifts but spent Mother’s Day with each other, our husbands and our own kids. \n\nMy mom told us after Father’s Day that she was hurt we didn’t do more for her in recent years. I said that since she put in almost no emotional labor into raising us, we are putting none into her. She said that our father and I had an agreement. I pointed out that yes, but we never agreed to it and it want fair that we grew up with an emotionally absent mother who didn’t want us.  And to be fair, we have had this conversation with our dad as well and he admits it wasn’t fair to us either. I also said if she didn’t want kids, then why should she be celebrated as a mom?\n\nMy mom is upset with both of us and called us ungrateful brats. My dad feels bad for her but supports our choice. AITA? \n\n\nEDIT: To those asking how I’d feel if my dad were the one that acted like this/how I feel about dads who do this in general: they suck just as much and it’s not fair to the kids, regardless of whatever agreement spouses come to.

My bday is in January & hers - July. She forgot my bday last year, promised to make it up to me but didnt. \nI wanted to visit NY last year because I had never been & we had discussed moving there. I told her & she said she couldnt afford it (she wasnt working and was in school) so I said I would cover the flights. I dont make much but I make enough for my own bills and a few extra things. She agreed & I booked our tickets. We decided to go during her bday. When looking at hotels it was about $800 each & she said that was fine & that her mom was going to give her money as a bday present to go towards the hotel. I assumed that meant towards the total of the hotel & we would split the rest. We didnt have to pay for the hotel till checkout. Before leaving for the trip she got a $60,000 inheritance from a grandparent. During the trip I found out that her grandparents had paid for her rent and schooling. \n\nWhen we got to the hotel she put her card down since it had more on it. As soon as the trip started she wanted to split things in a way we never had before. Normally we would pay for our individual orders. She now wanted to pay for every other meal. So if she gets dinner one night, I get it the next. I said no, but she insisted. It often ended up not being equal because she would order more than me. There were also instances where she suggested we pay for something together (ex: a drugstore haul where I got one thing and she got several & the total was $70)to make it faster & then stood behind me at the register like she was waiting for me to pay so I did. When the night of her bday dinner came she picked a very expensive place. The bill was over $300 & I thought we would split it since it was so much more than all our other dinners but when I got my card out she said “thank you for the dinner” & so I paid for it. On our last night she mentioned her birthday gift from her mom, $500 for the hotel. I said I thought she hadnt gotten it since she never mentioned it & she said she had a while ago. So it was just going towards her share. \n\nAt the end of the trip I used more money than I had budgeted because of the extra food/drinks/etc so I  was pulling from what I had saved for my rent. So I asked if it was okay if I gave her ½ now & ½  later. She said yes & that I could pay her the rest whenever. After we got back I realized how annoyed I was with the whole situation. I had paid for her flight because she couldnt afford it & now that she can she wasnt offering to pay me back? She had forgotten my birthday but I just paid $300 for her birthday dinner? I told a few friends about it & they were annoyed as well & told me not to pay her the rest of the money. So I didnt. The longer that went by I thought she just forgave the debt since I spent so much on the trip for her. Yesterday she asked about the money so thats not the case. Am I the asshole for not paying her back up until now?", "assistant": "ESH. You shouldn’t have agreed to pay her back - that said I am on your side about why you haven’t and let’s be honest, she’s a lot worse here.\n\nWhat you have to ask is how much is this friendship worth to me? If you don’t value it don’t pay her (tbh if you hadn’t agreed to I’d have gone with NTA). \n\nYou could ask to renegotiate the debt (and I expect it would come out you don’t owe her anything) - and include all the things you said about the bills being skewed, the flights etc .if she’s not receptive then she’s probably not worth keeping as a friend.\n\nThis is yet another reason why grown adults should not be celebrating other people’s birthday - close family only! It’s actually ridiculous to demand people to spend their time and money n something that should only be for children."}

And then I had to hear him complain because he hasn’t seen infinity wars or endgame, but they’re kind of referenced in this too, he was like “see this is why i didn’t watch to watch this, I haven’t seen that part” even though I’ve tried to watch them many times and they’ve been out for years. I know how he is, I don’t “not like him” but I’d rather not stop every time something is spoiled or he has a question since I’d be watching it for the first time too. \n\n\n\nI can’t even believe this is a problem but my boyfriend randomly brought up going to see Deadpool 3 this week since it’s out of theatres after Wednesday.  He’s never seen 1 and 2 but I have. I basically said “sure we’d have to watch 1 and 2 this week” which he said he doesn’t want to. I have no desire to sit in a movie theatre with someone who has no idea what’s going on so I said I don’t want to go, which he’s annoyed about now. He said that he heard it’s a good movie and he doesn’t care that he doesn’t know what’s going on. I don’t want to have to answer questions and if anything comes up in the movie that relates to 1 or 2 I can’t even talk about it since he has no idea what’s going on at all. That doesn’t seem like a fun time and I don’t feel like going to a movie theatre when I could just watch it alone in bed, I’d basically be watching it alone anyway. It’s the same thing if someone wanted to read book 3 of a series without 1 and 2, that makes no sense to me if you have no idea what led up to that. I told him to go himself then, I don’t want to waste a trip to the movie theatre for this. \nHe thinks I’m an asshole and it’s not normal to think this way and I just don’t even know why it’s an issue to begin with. I feel like it’s probably pretty common so I figured I’d see how Reddit felt. \n\nEdit: I feel like I need to clarify the fact the he wants to go because his friends keep telling him about it, not for me. I’ve been asking him to watch marvel movies with me for years, specifically the ones that already are out so he can catch up and he never does. It’s quite literally only because his friends keep mentioning it. \n\nEdit 2: based on the comments, it doesn’t really seem like 1 and 2 are necessary so I’ll just go see it with him.

Husband talked to her and set boundaries, so she stopped doing that when my husband is present but she was still doing it when it's only me in the room. So we agreed she cannot visit when husband is not at home and husband is not to leave me alone with her.  \n\nBecause of these boundaries we did not see them for 1.5months. They live 2hr away and we did not find a mutually good time. They finally came over last Sunday.  \n\n20min into the visit my FIL wants to see a lawnmower that has broken down so my husband goes into the backyard with him, leaving me, the baby and MIL inside. She's drinking coffee and eating cake. She sits next to my daughter on her playmat and tries to feed her some of her cake. I immediately told her no, she can't have that. MIL pretends not to hear me and proceeds putting her spoon to my daughter's closed mouth. I repeat stop doing that, she can't have cake yet and definitely not from your spoon. Still she pretends not to hear me. I repeat it again, still nothing and now there's cake on my baby's face and she's fussing.

We always thought that they were just going to be adopting so we never brought it up. But since the engagement I have noticed that he always talks about them as their children, as in biological. I don't know how to explain it but it didn't seem like they were going to adopt a child. After thinking about it for a while I decided to talk with Emma about it.

My sister (16f) and I (17m) were sitting with our cousins when our stepmother corrected us when we said we had big plans for Halloween and Christmas this year, because we were going to be with our maternal side of the family. She told us those plans still need to be approved by her because dad said yes without running it by her. This is when my dad's family stepped in and told her she doesn't have the right to stop us from spending time with our maternal family. My stepmother said as our mom she does, and since our maternal family never speaks to her or tries to befriend her she has the right to say they're not good for us. Then our grandparents told her she's not our mom and the more she pretends to be, the less respect she has from anyone. Then it became a situation where our grandparents and our aunts and uncles piled on her and reminded her that she didn't give birth to us, we didn't call her mom, they accused her of preying on a grieving man who was 11 months out from losing his wife when she swooped in and claimed us as hers and they rubbed it in her face that neither my sister or I actually value her or love her or want her in our lives. It became a huge fight between them and my stepmother stormed out. She tried to make my sister and me leave with her. But we refused to go with her and we said we were staying with our family.\n\nDad was pissed as hell when he came to pick us up and he asked me if I stepped in to defend my stepmother a woman in our family and I said no. He asked me why the hell not and I told him I didn't want to defend her and didn't disagree with everything being said. My stepmother asked why I hadn't spoken up for her and I told her because everything they said is true and I would never defend her from anything. Dad was threatening to not give us the extra time with mom's family at Christmas and my sister kinda talked him around on that because she cried to him which made him give in.\n\nBut I got lectured two days this week already about 10 years of being a stepmother deserving more respect and value and being worthy of defending. My dad told me I'm a few months away from being a man and I need to act more like one and that means defending the women in our lives, but especially the ones we love. I told him I always defend the people I love when I need to. This made my stepmother cry. It made my dad walk out of the room to calm down because his wife was crying. Dad told me I'm a bad example to my sister and the only reason she doesn't adore our stepmother is because she has followed my lead and I should think about my influence and the fact I'm risking a relationship with my stepmother in the future. \n\nI should add I have said similar things to her before and to my dad.

Initially I had preferred if I was to pay her full tuition that she would attend our local university and live at home. She convinced us to let her expand that search under the guise she was applying only to Catholic schools. When she was accepted into Georgetown University in Washington, DC, I was hesitant due to the 17 hour drive from Baton Rouge where we live… We were persuaded after a tour and because she was offered merit-based and needs-based scholarships which would cover nearly all of her tuition. Additionally, my brother and his spouse moved to Maryland near the DC area several months ago she would have family very nearby. \n\nUnbeknownst to myself and my husband, at the time she applied to other schools as well. She preferred to attend the University of Maryland. We told her if she expected us to provide any financial support then it would be to a Catholic university. We were also disappointed she would choose this school over Georgetown, which had been so kind to her, and also never having toured this other school. Knowing this, she still wanted to attend University of Maryland. We told her she is an adult and we cannot controll her, but she will learn there are long term consequences to adult choices, namely student loans. \n\nI since learned she had cried of this issue to my brother, who offered to pay for all of her tuition. He has no children of his own and he contributes nothing to the care of our elderly parents. I texted him and explicitly asked him not to do this because my daughter needs to learn she will not always be rescued. He not only told me it’s his money and he will do whatever he “damn well pleases” with it, but he also told me my lesson is “an absolute joke.” We got into a heated argument over this, and I told him I am concerned about his influence over my daughter as he has been an atheist for decades, among other issues, and my daughter looks up to him immensely… College is already a difficult time for faith… He told me I’m not helping that by “alienating her.” I tried to be civil and urged him to consider my plea to which he replied he “doesn’t need to consider it.” \n\nThere is now considerable tension between us, and with my daughter.

Him and my mom had been divorced before that and they used to split custody and she's been remarried to my stepdad for years. \n\nMy baby sister turned 1 a couple of days ago and my mom is 5 months pregnant with a baby boy. I guess the problem started when my sister started teething? It was at the beginning of summer break and mom would just let her cry it out in her nursery alone and my sister is LOUD. Not only was it annoying but also kind of sad because she's just a baby and going through pain alone so I used to grab her and try to soothe her. Being held and letting her chew on her fingers helped her some and I saw a TikTok of a teething baby using a cucumber and tried that too and it was like magic. \n\nAnyway, I thought babies just teeth once and I was so wrong, so it became a routine of me taking care of her a lot? Mom didn't care as long as she wasn't crying, and I liked hanging out with her. It wasn't 24/7 obviously, I had a part-time job and friends but whenever I came home, she would practically leap out of Mom/Stepdad's arms wanting to come to me. She also started fussing a lot whenever my mom would try to put her to sleep, like full-on baby kickboxing but she doesn't have that problem with me. She just kind of cuddles up to my chest and drifts off.\n\nAnyway, I thought that was a baby being a baby, but my mom was fuming after my sister's birthday party because she wouldn't let my mom hold her in pictures or for the cake cutting and my grandma made a comment about my sister and I being Siamese twins, but I just took it as we're close? Idk. My mom was fuming like I said, and she said that I'm confusing my sister into thinking I'm her mom and that I need to take a step back and stop it.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do just ignore her whenever she cries or whenever she babbles for me?

We are both in college and supposed to share the household responsibilities, but I feel like I am carrying everything while she does almost nothing. After months of fights we agreed that I would cook and wash the dishes, and she would clean the living room/hallway (we both have our own rooms and bathrooms) and do the laundry. She also agreed not to use the kitchen unless she cleaned up after herself.\n\nIn reality, I cook and clean the kitchen everyday, but she only does her chores once a week if at all. This means often don't have clean towels or clothes, and the floors are constantly dirty. I also wake up to a messy kitchen and piles of dirty dishes because she never sticks to our agreement. When I call her out, she says \"I was gonna do it later\" accuses me of nagging, and claims I'm trying to start a fight. I can wait all day, but she'll still clean nothing. It drives me crazy and I end up snapping at her.\n\nOn top of that, she spends money recklessly (mostly on snacks and skincare), then calls me stingy for budgeting carefully. We don't much money so I save for bills and emergencies, She'll ask for more money when hers runs out, while I feel guilty even asking my parents because they already say finances are tight. Mom always defends her, saying, \"we'll send more if it runs out give her what she wants\" but then complains to me about not having enough left. Meanwhile, my sister insists her essentials (skincare and matcha) should come from the household allowance.\n\nThe issue is, whenever I get frustrated and react, she flips the story. She tells my mom and grandma that I \"treat her badly.\" Once, my grandma saw me speaking harshly to her (after she had left a huge mess) and now thinks I'm mean.

She's really struggled to find another job in her since, as it's a really bad for her field, and people are being laid off left and right. She's currently working as a waitress while she looks for a more permanent job, but isn't earning enough to fully cover her rent.\n\nI have a pretty well paying job, and I share rent with my partner, so I offered to help her cover the rent while she looks for another job. She was extremely grateful, and together we agreed on an amount which would allow her to cover rent and also have some money left over for food, travel etc. It's important to note that her monthly expenses for food, travel, bills etc were all provided by her.\n\nI didn't have any issues, or suspect that anything was amiss. She hates working as a waitress so I'm confident that she is doing everything in her power to find another job. The last time I saw her, she mentioned that she has picked up a few extra shifts recently so that she can afford to get our parents a nice anniversary gift, so I figured she was basically living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nFast forward to now, and I've just received word from our cousin that my sister is in Paris. When I expressed confusion, my cousin sent me a bunch of screenshots from my sister's Instagram. My sister must have blocked me and my parents on there, because none of us could see any of her posts or stories.\n\nI was very confused, then angry, because if she is living paycheck to paycheck, how on earth can she afford to go on a trip to Europe? For context, we live in Australia, and plane tickets typically cost upwards of $1000, and that's not accounting for food, hotels, or anything else.\n\nI was so pissed that not only has she gone on an expensive trip, she clearly tried to hide it from me. I ended up sending her a few short messages, basically saying that I knew she was in Europe and that clearly she doesn't need my help paying rent anymore if she can afford a big trip.\n\nShe called me, and was basically in tears begging me not to cut her off. She said that she is on the trip with her new boyfriend, and that he is paying for everything. She insisted that she still needs the money to cover her rent, and that she will have to move if I don't help her. I basically told her that it was her problem now, and hung up, which I admit was childish of me but I was still so mad.\n\nI don't know much about her new boyfriend, so maybe he is a millionaire or something, but the fact that she tried to hide it from me sets off alarm bells. I'll obviously have a proper discussion with her when she gets back, but for now I'm going to block her number.\n\nSince then, she has reached out to some other family members, who think I'm being too harsh and should give her the benefit of the doubt. They all seem to think I'm going to force her to be out on the streets.\n\nIt's looking like this will be a whole fiasco once she gets back. I need an outside opinion. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the responses!\n\nI decided that at the very least I should let my sister explain herself, so I rang her again after I had calmed down. She said that the trip was a very last minute thing, and that her boyfriend was already going to Europe and he offered to pay for her plane ticket so she could come along with him and she felt that it was too good of an offer to pass up. When I asked about other expenses, she told me that he was mostly paying for everything and she only had to contribute a small amount. When I asked her where she got the money for that, she got kinda defensive and said that she had saved some money while working as a waitress, and that it wasn't fair that I was judging her for just trying to have a break, and that's why she didn't tell me.\n\nI did bring up that he could help her pay rent, but she said that they hadn't been dating for that long, and she doesn't feel comfortable asking him. I think he comes from quite a well-off family, and she doesn't want to come across like a gold-digger. I do get this, I think it would be weird to ask someone you hadn't known for that long.\n\nI do believe her for the most part, but I'm still pissed that she didn't tell me and that she clearly did have some money saved that could have been used to contribute to rent. I'm also pretty convinced that the money she said would go towards a gift for our parents also got spent on the trip, which feels a bit scummy.\n\nI did stand my ground about no longer paying her rent, but I did agree to discuss it again once she got back. However, I will definitely ask to see her bank statements before I give her a cent more, and if it turns out she has been scamming me then not only will I not give her any more money but I will make her pay back what I loaned her.", "assistant": "NTA. \n\n1.

They were depressed. Her husband didn't want to use donor sperm to have a kid. He didn't want to raise a child not genetically his. So my mom decided she would find a \"donor\" behind his back, aka she cheated on him, with guys that apparently looked enough like him so she could pass the kid off as his. She confided in her sister, my aunt. It was three guys, one night stands with each, all of them had the same physical characteristics of the husband. He was overjoyed when she got pregnant and then my aunt told him the truth. He'd had doubts but felt bad about accusing her of cheating but hearing it was enough for him to say he wanted no part of this. They did a DNA anyway because there was a chance I was his but I wasn't and he divorced my mom and did not take any kind of role in my life.\n\nMy mom never got over her ex. She has loved him all this time and I'm 17 now. I have met her ex. She set up these circumstances for him to see us in the hopes he would fall in love with me. But he never wanted any part of it and then he got married again and actually had a bio kid (apparently confirmed with DNA).\n\nThen when I was 11 my mom got remarried. She doesn't love her husband, I'm not even sure she really likes him. She's trying to get over her ex. Her husband knows this. He also knows she slept around to have me. And he hates it and I get the brunt of it. He's always such a dick to me. He acts like I wanted to meet mom's ex and be paraded in front of him like some sort of doll. He gets annoyed when I ask my mom for any info on the guys she slept with (I would like to know who my bio father is). He gets annoyed that mom put her ex on my birth certificate. He hates that I have the ex's last name. He brings these things up so much. As well as telling me I should be nicer to mom because when she mentions her ex I tell her she should get past it.\n\nMom's husband was in such a bad mood Friday because my mom found out her ex and his wife and kid moved away. He told me that I should change my name and birth certificate now and stop holding onto some random guys info. I told him I'm 17, that's not something I can change yet, it's up to his wife. He told me I'm always so difficult and always rubbing his face in shit. He told me I could try being more understanding. I told him he could try growing up and not being such a dick to me when I don't have control over shit my mom does or has done in the past. He told me I have no right to speak to him, an adult, like that.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA\n\nYou didn't choose any of this.

As the meeting was long, my workplace decided to host a free lunch period (basically pizza and other food). This was mentioned beforehand in an email sent to everyone. Due to various personal and family-related reasons, I take my own packed lunch to work. I can't see myself eating both my lunch and the free food provided, as that would be impossible, plus I don't want to waste my own lunch.\n\nAfter the first half of the meeting, we had lunch in the room itself. I opened up my own bag while a lot of other people went to get the pizza. After like a few minutes, one coworker whom I've never spoken to before (as I've only started three weeks ago) came up to me and said something like \"Hey, there's free pizza if you want it\". This is where I got a little annoyed, because 1) the pizza boxes were literally across the room, obviously they were there. And 2) I was very clearly eating my own lunch, which I thought made it clear that I decided to forego the free work-provided lunch. So I told him something along the lines, \"No thanks, I have my own lunch, as you can see. That means I'm not going for the free pizza.\"\n\nHe said okay and then left. Later after work I told my parents about this when they asked me about what we did at work, and they said I was being rude by saying that, saying I could have left it at \"no thanks\". Granted, I was a bit annoyed, but I thought my simple explanation to my coworker was diplomatic and further clarified what was going on.\n\nWas AITA here?\n\n  \n**EDIT:** Hey there, thanks to everyone for giving their insight and pointing out what I did was wrong. I've learned my lesson well - I was very much the asshole in this scenario. I failed to understand at the moment why saying something like \"I have my own lunch, as you can see\" is inherently rude, and now I know that was not acceptable at all.\n\nThough I didn't understand the social nuance of this interaction at first (due to my Aspergers), that is by NO means any excuse for my actions, and I am still responsible for what I say. Next week, I plan on speaking to the coworker the next chance I get and apologizing to him for my actions and words. He definitely did not deserve to be treated that way by me.\n\nThanks again to everyone for their input, I really do appreciate it.

Since he was around 17, he's suffered with substance abuse issues and alcohol dependency. He's been through counselling on more than one occasion, and I've lost count of the amount of times that either my wife or I have had to make personal sacrifices to go and tend to him. He's currently living in a Recovery Housing Program, where we hoped he would see improvements.\n\nThis has caused understandable issues for Jess. I've missed hockey games and choir performances because I had to go tend to Jake, as has my wife. We try and make it up to her at the time, but I don't think missing important milestones really makes up for it; it's heartbreaking for me personally. \n\nJake has been doing better lately, and he hasn't had any relapses or issues for the past few months.

She's off to college, graduating with a great GPA and we're really proud of her. \n\nHowever, only a couple of hours before the graduation, we received a call from the staff at Jake's Housing Program, who said that he had a relapse incident and was in a really bad way. My wife was hysterical and immediately started telling me we had to go there and help. I refused. I said that we'd missed enough events in Jess' life, and I wasn't missing her graduation. Although my wife told me how sad she was to miss it, Jake's health and wellbeing would take priority. I wasn't changing my stance. She got increasingly agitated and said she'd go herself, called a cab, and went. I took the car and watched Jess' graduation. It was one of the proudest days of my life, but when I saw Jess at the end, I could tell she was visibly upset that her mom wasn't there. I explained and you could tell her frustration.\n\nMy wife made it to our celebratory dinner later, and she apologized, but the mood was sour. The incident with Jake was serious, but not a life threatening emergency, and he has been admitted into treatment. \n\nMy wife gave me the cold shoulder later saying how we should have been on the same page, been there for support, and that I'd been selfish. I disagreed, saying she'd been selfish in this scenario, and she tainted Jess' moment.

When I stated nannying this past summer, I realized quickly that it would be unlike any other job I've had (why that is is for another discussion).\n\nAny who, a few weeks ago, one of the kids had their birthday. Their mom asked me to make them a cake for their party because I have previous experience making cakes. While she was out running errands, I got started on the cake and I ended up burning it because the kids were fighting and I had to deal with that. As I was cleaning up the mess from the burnt cake, the 3 y/o came up to me and asked why I as throwing the cake away to which I responded, \"oh, it's because I made a mistake and burned it.\" He then asked, \"what's a mistake?\" Seeing this as a valuable teaching moment, I said \"A mistake is when you do something wrong by accident. Mistakes aren't a bad thing-- even grown ups like me make them! I actually think it is good to make mistakes, because you can learn from them! All you need to do is start over and try again.\" He was very content with that answer, and I didn't think anything about it.\n\nWhen his mom got home, she yelled at me for burning the cake. She was LIVID! I don't understand why, especially because I offered to reimburse her for the wasted materials and stay late without pay to make a new cake, but she screamed at me nonetheless and said she'll make it herself. \n\nSince then, the 3 y/o has been terrified of making mistakes. He won't do anything independently. She made me spend an hour each morning teaching him how to write, and one morning while he was refusing to write his name out of the fear of making a mistake, she stood up and screamed at the other kids and I. She said \"Who taught him what mistake means?! When I find out, I'm going to be pissed! This is going to ruin him!\" I was shocked by her reaction, but once the initial fear wore off (the kids and I were terrified of her), I decided to own up to it because I didn't want the kids to get punished for it. \n\nI calmly explained that it was me and told her exactly what I said, and she fired me. She didn't give me an explanation why, the only thing she said (after months of me working for them) was \"I'll submit your last paystub\".

There’s more to the story and how I grew up but it feels very intentional and controlling of them to pull this stunt.\n\nEdit to add: I have no money out aside for the dress as I was under the impression this was going to be set in done in a week and I’d have the dress paid for. All my other funds went to other wedding related things. My hands are super tied and I really can’t afford a dress without their support. \n\nEdit 2: even with a budget from the initial grandma. She will say a price & if she doesn’t love a dress under that budget she will find a way to say she can’t pay for it. On the other hand, if there is a dress over her budget she loves, she will pay for it. It is very calculated and conditional to what she wants and her preference.", "assistant": "ESH. This is what people mean when they talk about money coming with strings attached. \n\nPaying for something typically meant you get input on the thing you pay for. A couple of decades go by and people said a gift should be freely given and not have those conditions attached. So the expectations are off from one generation to the next. \n\nAt the end of the day, they are offering a conditional gift. Accept it or find your own way, those are the only two options you've got."}

With my birthday approaching, I wanted a small dinner with female friends. I invited only a tight-knit group, including my best friend (36F, Emily) and my older sister (42F, Sarah). However, another one of my closest friends (35F, Anna) just got engaged, and the thought of hearing her talk about wedding planning makes my skin crawl. I can’t stand the idea of sitting there while she gushes over flowers, venues, and every little bullshit that feels so painful to me right now.\n\nWith the dinner just a week away, I decided to send a message to the group, “Okay, listen up: there will be absolutely NO wedding talk at my birthday dinner. I just got out of a relationship and I refuse to spend my special day listening to that. I deserve one night to celebrate myself so let’s focus on me!”. Instead of the understanding I expected, I was met with backlash. Emily texted me privately saying my message was too aggressive.\n\nI reached out to my sister but she completely dismissed me. She told me I should be more considerate of others and accused me of being jealous. That’s when I completely lost it. I pointed out how I’ve endured Sarah endlessly talk about her boring husband and stupid sons for years without a single complaint, yet she couldn’t muster any empathy for me during this tough time. She reacted badly to this and call me unhinged. \n\nI am tired of being judged for wanting my birthday to be about me and for my friends and sister to care about my wellbeing instead of being so obsessed with men.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "assistant": "YTA.

Which is why I'm reaching out to reddit for some third party insight.\n\nMy MiL has recently moved back to our hometown after finally escaping from her ex. My husband and I were unaware of the severity of the situation (because MiL made efforts to hide it), and I know that my husband is feeling very guilty about it.\n\nBut MiL is doing better and has her own little apartment in town and has been working and rebuilding her life. We've made efforts to support her as much as possible, but we are in a tight spot financially, so what we can do is limited.\n\nFor the past few couple weeks, my MiL has been inviting us over to her place for dinner multiple times a week. She has always loved to cook, and says she is excited to get to cook for family again. Plus she gets to spend time with our toddler.\n\nThe problem is that she has consistently told us to be there around 6pm, only for her to not have dinner ready until 9pm or later. And she refuses any help in the kitchen.\n\nThis is a major issue because we wind up staying out passed our daughter's bedtime. Her whole nighttime routine gets thrown off, and it makes it harder to get her down for bed. Not to mention how cranky she gets waiting on the food.\n\nI've tried to gently talk to my MiL about this, but she has always been critical of me, and of my parenting. She thinks it's outrageous that I keep my daughter on such a strict schedule, and insists that when her kids were little, they didn't have schedules, and just ate when they were hungry and fell asleep when they were tired and it worked out just fine.\n\nI asked my husband to talk to his mom about it, but she basically told him the same thing. Then went off on him about how she was just trying to help us out financially by providing a few meals for us, and how it was terrible of us to try to make her feel bad for just wanting to spend time with her family.\n\nSo he dropped it, and we've been back to her place for dinner a couple more times since then. And it's still been served at 9pm. And she's been making passive aggressive comments about how I need to loosen up and how I can't expect the world to stick to my schedule.\n\nAnd my husband thinks we should just put up with it because his mom has been through so much, and he feels partially responsible because he was unaware of the situation and wasn't able to protect her. But after a particularly critical phone call with her yesterday, I told my husband that I didn't want to go to her place for dinner anymore. He insisted that she's just stressed because of everything she's been through, and we need to show her some leniency.\n\nI told him that she can come over to our place for dinner every now and then, that would be fine. But I'm not going to be held captive at her apartment anymore. We didn't really come to an agreement, though. And I'm thinking that maybe I'm being too harsh on my MiL, and torturing my husband in the process.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "assistant": "NTA\n\nChildrearing theories have evolved over the decades since your MIL raised free-range children. \n\nIf you absolutely cannot refuse the invitation (which is not a summons, BTW), pack some dinner for your little one and stick to your bedtime routine so she isn’t cranky and fussy. \n\nIf MIL still has a problem with it, because waiting for 3 hours past a specified time isn’t rude at all, then you need to present a united front with your spouse that your daughter will have a structured routine. \n\nInfo: what does she make that requires 3 hours of prep time?"}

So we were all having dinner, mom and dad, half siblings (mom's kids with her ex-husband) and their spouses, full siblings, and me and Ash. During dinner my parents asked Ash if she'd heard from her siblings recently and Ash said no and she wouldn't expect to ever hear from them. \n\nAsh was raised with half siblings who were older than her but did not like that she existed and made sure she knew she was less than in their eyes for being half. They chose no contact once they turned 18 and cut off their (shared) dad too. Ash carries some sadness around because of it. She's an only child otherwise and still loves them and sometimes struggled with the little girl inside of her who really looked up to them. But she's working with a therapist to make sure she's doing better mentally. Especially now that she's an adult who has accepted she'll never have a relationship with them.\n\nMy siblings brought up that they find the half thing weird and we never used it and nobody they know would ever personally use it. Mom said it's not something that should be encouraged and she'll never understand anyone dividing family up that way.\n\nMy half siblings said they just don't want to think people use it, but they do all of the time. They said they always used it for us. That most of us just closed our ears off to it and liked to pretend we're all full siblings. They said we're not and the relationship they have with the rest of us will always be less than the one they have with each other because they have an entirely different side of their family to us and a different dad to us and we only think it's the same because we never went through divorce and/or death of a parent. They went through both. My half siblings went onto say their kids know we're not their real aunts and uncles and that our dad isn't their real grandpa. And it's dumb to think step and half are ignored.\n\nMy half siblings left and the rest of my family tried blaming Ash because she brought it up (my parents did, not Ash) and look what she started kind of thing. My mom said that kind of talk was never in our house before. I told them to stop and when they tried to say Ash working on accepting \"half is less\" (which she's not working to accept that but to accept her half siblings not wanting anything to do with her) I suggested to Ash that we leave and told my family that I was not going to tolerate that from them.

My sister is 19 and has just started university, her boyfriend is 17 and still in high school and lives in our home town. They have been together for 6 months and this is my sister's first relationship. Contrary to everyone's expectations, she is very passionate about this boy, constantly posts pictures of the two of them on social media, and spends every minute of every day with him when she comes home from university. My family doesn't approve of him due to his unconventional style (he has a lot of piercings and tattoos), the fact that he smokes and that he is not an \"intellectual\" (their words not mine - I don't really know him yet) having rarely left our home town and his dream being opening his own tattoo and piercing shop. \n\nThe plan was for us all to go out for pizza or drinks, just the four of us (my long-term partner was there as well), however I had a long day at that point and wanted to stay in, so I suggested we have dinner with the family and play cards after. When we got home that day, they were already there and introductions were had. I shook his hand and started at him blankly. My sister instantly asked why am I staring at him like that. Truth is, I was having difficulty processing the fact that she has a boyfriend - in my head, she is still my innocent 12-year-old little sister as I left the family home and moved to the UK for university at age 18. Me and her boyfriend didn't really hit it off, we just sat next to each other at dinner barely talking. Normally, when I first meet someone I bombard them with questions to get to know them, but I was finding it hard to talk to him at all. He didn't talk much to us either, an added difficulty was that he's not a confident English speaker and my boyfriend is British and doesn't speak our language.\n\nWhen dinner has finished, I was ready to play cards in the hope that the atmosphere will brighten, but my sister's boyfriend mumbled something and they decided to go to him place instead. I was a bit taken aback by that as we barely got a chance to get to know him, and I texted my sister later on Snapchat to make her aware. She texted back saying her boyfriend felt unwelcome and that's why they left, to which I said communication is a two-way thing and when someone who's not family is invited for dinner, I'd expect that person to make some effort to get to know the members. Bearing in mind he's only 17, I told myself he's just a kid and I can't expect him to behave like an adult. We didn't meet him again until me and my partner left for the UK, so I feel like we left things unresolved and I don't know when we'll be next home as I only visit once or twice a year.\n\nIt also doesn't help that my sister and I are not that close, but considering everyone in the family has rejected this boy, I want to be her ally in this, but don't know how to handle the situation. Was I the A-hole?", "assistant": "YTA. Sounds like all of you are. Judging him on tattoos and piercings and his dreams. Just so you know... Tattoos and piercings don't make someone a bad person...

She took 45 minutes to do so although, I live 10mins away and was only 5 away from pickup. Fast forward to the next day, my little sister informs me that while she was with our Aunt, she saw our estranged mother whom is only allowed to be seen during supervised visits with CPS only. I texted my Aunt and asked her if it were true. She began telling me there was “no need for me to tell you because that is her mom” and she began attacking me verbally. She said she isn’t wrong for hiding it, she invalidated how I felt, she disregarded how crucial it is for me to know these things. \n\nThe rest of my family also began to text me.

I will wait it out, most fun aunt duties don’t come to play until he is older anyway. Thank you for the people out there who responded kindly even when telling me I’m in the wrong I appreciate it. My intentions were good but the actual actions would not be. I’ll also be sure to keep opinions to myself in front of his parents so no undermining happens, I appreciate that being pointed out too.\n\nAlso guys i’m 20 with no children that is why I asked, I know I do not have good gauge for these things because as stated my nephew is also the only child I like. I appreciate you helping me get perspective so I can adjust what I know for future situations with him. I want to be in his life always so thank you to those of you who (KINDLY) pointed out it would be a mistake that would jeopardize that. \n\n\n\n\n\nI 20F have a nephew 4M who is literally the only child I like because he is the cutest sweetest little baby ever. I actually cannot talk about it too much or I’ll ramble on about how perfect he is forever. \n\nThe Reason for my posting here is: he is starting to get into music now. Not like baby shark and nursery rhymes like actual real music. Unfortunately both of his parents are very boring default setting people. They like country so that is all he knows, It made me cringe when the little angel told me his favourite song was “Tipsy.” \n\nI played him one metal song before (non-explicit) and both his parents said it was weird music. They both HATE anything alternative leaning They aren’t republican or ultra religious (or really religious at all) they just like country. I just feel like it is my duty as his cool aunt to give him a chance to see all the music that is out there. And maybe also save him from having a bad music taste. The tipsy song isn’t very child appropriate so I feel like non-explicit slipknot songs should be fine too but i’m unsure. \n\nAs much as I love him and am involved in raising him he isn’t my kid. I feel like not letting him listen because they look scary and intimidating isn’t fair. I wouldn’t make him watch any music videos or anything i’m not trying to scar him. But once again it isn’t my choice. They have never said I can’t but they were a bit scandalized when I did once before. \n\nI worry about the kid. Both parents want him to be a country loving sports star and he is only 3. I feel like he deserves the chance to know there is other stuff out there. I also like other music beyond metal and considered showing him that and working my way up to metal. But he already did like the one song I played for him before. \n\nTLDR: I want to show my nephew slipknot because his parents only play him country. They have never said I cant but also have outwardly said they dont like my music. I want to but I don’t wanna cause a gigantic drama.", "assistant": "YWBTA come on, the kid is 4.

Mum's a SAHM, father was sole provider. I come from the opposite - my mother pretty much forbade from ever being financially dependent on a man and drilled that into me early on. \n\nMy husband worked hard to unlearn the values he saw replicated at home. He (often more than) pulled his weight at home, was an engaged and present father and a genuine partner. The one thing that grinds my gears is how much weight he puts on the opinions of his family. I get that we all want our parents to be proud of us, but this is too much.\n\nMy ILs are staying with us for 2 weeks. Our usual MO is, I prep breakfast, we all eat lunch at work/school, and my husband makes dinner. We have a cleaner, but she's on holiday so in the meantime we're DIYing the cleaning where it's down to everyone to keep their space clean and common spaces we all clean. This is how we've always done it, and it works. \n\nMy ILs hate that I'm 'one of those modern women'. They hate that I work, they hate that I don't find my purpose in being a wife and mother and they hate that my husband pulls his weight at home. We spoke pretty frankly early on, where I established my boundaries and told them I won't be chastised about how I live my life in my home.

I typically get home 1815/30 and we eat at 1900. I said quick hellos and ran up for a pre-dinner shower. When I came down, I went to the kitchen to help set up for dinner and found nothing ready. I asked my husband about it but he wouldn't look at me and his mother answered that he hadn't cooked anything. She told me I needed to do my duty as a wife and cook for my family. My coward of a husband still wasn't looking at me. I just walked away and ordered takeaway. I dished up for me and my kids and we sat at the table to eat.

He said tradition was tradition for a reason and it was kind of insulting that I thought I was too good for how he was raised. \n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. I told him tradition won't allow a man on 35k to support a family of 5 and he was too broke to be so sexist. He looked hurt and I saw tears welling in his eyes. He excused himself from the table. I regret saying this in front of our children, but him saying that to me after I'm busting my ass to clean up his mess on top of having to deal with his parents was too much for me.

He gambled and lost on that and I am really proud that you did not bow down just because his parents were there or that the kids were in the room. Too many people let things like this slide so as not to upset the apple cart. \n\nThis is all on him. He decided it was better for him and easier for him risk your feelings than stand up to his parents.  \n\nHe chose to upset you versus upsetting his mother. \n\nI honestly would not have let them have any of the take out food.

Lina stands and points the camera right in my face like, “birthday girl reveal!” I put my hand over the lens and said, “stop” I didn’t grab the phone or touch her, just covered the camera for a second. She snaps that I “ruined her shot” and this is her job. MIL says to “let it go for one night.” I said that it’s my night - actually.\n\nIt got awkward fast. Server was right there, I felt embarassed. Husband tried to change the subject, but Lina kept muttering about how she had to scrap “everything.” I even paid for my own dessert (long story) and we left pretty quick.\n\nNext morning Lina texts that I “humiliated” her and made her look unprofessional in front of everyone.

There were six of us, and it was just a weekend getaway. One important detail: one of our friends (35F) had a birthday coming up the day after the trip ended, and she was also on her period during this trip. \n\nWe spent the weekend exploring, eating great food and enjoying the hospitality-- but it was hot and humid. One night, we wanted to go line dancing, so to get into the mood, we bought cowboy hats and boots. I even had to buy a pair of jeans since I only packed shorts. After shopping, we went back to the hotel to get dressed. Four of us were ready to go, but we got a text from my friend (35F) saying she and her boyfriend (also our friend) were going to take a nap. I understood--she was on her period, it was hot, and it probably would've been miserable for her. So we decided to let them rest. \n\nFew hours passed and some of us got antsy, so we went to a local spot for drinks and live music while we waited. At this point, we were having the time of our lives. Another hour went by, and by then we noticed the line for the dance hall was wrapped around the building. There was no way we were getting in before closing, so we decided to just stay where we were. That's when she texted saying they were awake and ready to go line dancing. I told her it was too late and to meet us at the spot instead. They came, but they seemed a little upset that we didn't go line dancing. We tried to do some celebration there but she wasn't having it. Kept saying no to our drinks or us trying to celebrate her. \n\nHere's the thing: throughout the trip, we tried to do stuff during the day, but either she was too tired, wanted to nap, or got cranky, so plans kept stalling or not happening. There was zero communication from her on what she wanted to do or what the plan was. We make plans and we do them but she ended up staying in with her boyfriend so the rest of us thought they just wanted to be on their own which was fine. By this point, most of us (except her BF) were getting pretty annoyed despite us trying to understand. \n\n  \nFast forward-- the trip was over and we all came home. I got a text this morning from her saying she was upset we didn't celebrate her birthday while we were in Tennessee. I replied, \"you didn't want to do anything and took a 5-hour nap when we could have had fun and celebrating your birthday while line-dancing. I understand you needed rest, but how do we celebrate when the person we're celebrating isn't even there?\"\n\nSo--AITA for not celebrating her birthday on the trip?", "assistant": "NTA - She should have spoken up and made plans. your not her mom, you don't have to plan her birthday party."}

I made the two of us some spaghetti, but didn’t put any sauce or anything on it and just made it plain. My Mum refused the meal completely, saying “oh, seriously, I am not eating THAT!” when I have it to her and ate none of it. I told my Dad about what happened later. He told me that he’d tell her it was HIS idea to make the spaghetti like that as to avoid me getting the blame. \n\nAbout a month later, I decided to bring this up to my older sister. We were both alone at the time, just doing a jigsaw together. I don’t remember why but I found an opportunity in the conversation we were having to bring this up to her. The reason I did was because I was looking for a third party opinion. I was still really shook and upset by what had happened that I was sort of hoping to confide in my sister, or at least get some more clarity. After I’d told her what happened, she thought it over for a second and told me “Hm, no, you were in the wrong“. I was pretty confused by this, but she began to explain her reasoning pretty quickly. She explained to me that the purpose of a partner is to provide for the family, and that what I did wasn’t good enough. She also began to explain how other members of the family such as her boyfriend and our Dad also didn’t contribute enough, but by this point I was pretty confused and upset so I didn’t really respond to her. A few minuets later we just went back to our jigsaw like normal but I was pretty shaken by her words. I don’t want to be a non-provider to the family, but it’s not like the spaghetti I made was pretty stellar either, so I wasn’t sure how to feel. Once my family came back they also noticed I was pretty “out of it” and asked if I was ok, but I didn’t want to start a whole family argument or debate so I just told them I was tired and took an early night. \n\nSince all of this, I have once tried to bring this up to my sister. About a month ago I told my sister “you hurt me” but didn’t get to specify why. My words immediately made the room really awkward and nobody really said anything for a while. My sister tried to pull up examples on the past of me doing wrong, but sort of crumbled and trailed off partway through. My Mum said “tut, you two!” and rolled her eyes, but things went back to being awkwardly silent after. I’m kinda glad I voiced my hurt to her, but she was too defensive at the time to really explain any further, so we all just dropped it. It was super uncomfortable and I realised then that I can’t really bring up these issues with my family, so I’m doing it here to a bunch of (hopefully level-headed) strangers. \n\nI’s like someone to tell me what steps I should take from here. If you tell me I’m wrong or right, I just wanna know at this point.", "assistant": "YTA, but this was a year ago?

It began after my younger sister (13F) stopped talking to one of the boys on their walk to school and at school. We assumed that he and his friend would stop after a couple weeks but it’s been over two years at this point. It’s  just been annoying most of the time, throwing garbage in our yard, running through the yard to scare our cats sitting in the windows, blasting music towards our house, etc.. Last year, the two boys began running up to our door and body slamming and kicking the door once a day for two weeks. We asked them politely to stop as it could damage the door/door frame and said that if they did it again we would talk to their parents. They stopped messing with us altogether for a couple months after that then the usual shenanigans resumed minus the kicking/body slamming the door.\nHowever within the last couple months (starting when school ended for the summer), the kids have begun throwing milk cartons from the local lunch in the park program at our house and/or opening the cartons and pouring them in the yard near the door. They’ve also been leaving a speaker near open windows and blasting random sounds and music at all hours of the day and night and tapping on the windows during the day.\nOver the weekend, the boys printed out “WANTED” signs with a picture of one of them on it and taped them to each of our windows and both the front and back doors. We took them all down but kept one as evidence of what happened. Then last night around 1:30 am, they were out throwing things towards the house, hitting the street signs with metal poles and blasting music and weird sounds towards the open windows. We’d assumed they had stopped after a while of them finally being quiet, however one of the boys came up to my open window, face on the screen, and whispered menacingly “you’re on the FBI watchlist”. It obviously scared the shit out of me and I said “wtf dude, leave and don’t do it again”. Then the other boy did the same exact thing at my window. I got up and asked my younger sister if they’d also done it to her, she had her window closed so we assumed they didn’t try talking, but she said she heard tapping on her window. My mom went outside to see where they were or if they were still in the yard and saw them sneaking back to under my window again. My mom told them if she caught them doing it again that we would call the police and make a report. \nWe also will be talking to their parents later today when they get home. Ideally, we don’t want to call the police, but I honestly don’t think they’d stop even after talking with the parents.

He stuck around for a couple of years but when they broke up he left the kids too. He paid no child support, made no effort to keep in touch with the kids, did not check if they were okay, nothing. The rest of my family let the relationship drop too but I (38m) was the exception. I stayed part of my niece and nephew's lives. I still have a good relationship with them today and they're close to my kids.\n\nFive years ago my brother got married and now he's expecting baby #3 with his wife. After settling into family life he started to think more about his oldest two and he made the decision to reach out to them. He was met with silence initially and then after speaking to his ex, he got a brief message from his kids that they were still mad and hurt that he left. They had contact for about a month and it was sporadic. He asked if they could meet in person and the kids said no. But they said they would do a video call with him one time and that was it. This call happened 2.5 months into their \"reconciliation\". At some point during this he mentioned wanting them to meet his wife and other kids. They told him that was not going to happen and they didn't want to reconcile with him. My brother was surprised, he had thought that them opening up to him about being angry and hurt was a sign that they were willing to work through that. They told him it would be one thing if he hadn't settled down and started a family all over again but the fact he did that and then reached out to them was too much for them and they want nothing to do with the family he created now. This led to a back and forth where he said they have younger siblings and they told him very clearly they will never acknowledge or accept them as siblings and they will never accept him as their dad and he needs to move on.\n\nI spoke to my niece and nephew after the call, they reach out to me, and they said it was good to close that door and to have the decision be their own. They felt like they got closure.\n\nMy brother wasn't prepared for the outcome and his wife is furious that my niece and nephew rejected them for existing. She started badmouthing the kids at my parents house in front of all of us. My brother told her to stop. But she told him they should be ashamed of themselves for reacting like spoiled brats who don't get their way and punishing innocent children when they're supposed to be grown adults now. I told SIL she should be ashamed of herself for talking like that about the kids my brother abandoned and didn't give a second thought to until he had settled down with her and their kids.

They and their friends were the only people who seemed to accept me for who I was: a quiet, nerdy girl who didn't talk much.\n\nThey then began to notice things different about me. My awkwardness, my \"weirdness\", the way I would space out a lot. My memory problems, my overstimulation due to Emma naturally being a loud person, I could probably go on.\n\nAnyway, I once said hi to Lexi's friend Claire. I thought nothing of it. However, Lexi and Claire had just ended a conversation, so Lexi blocked me on every social media and spread rumors about me, saying I was a stalker and a creep who was obsessed with Lexi and trying to listen to their private conversation. I literally just walked up to Claire, she smiled and said hi, and I walked away. Lexi, when we were texting, was also very rude and passive-aggressive to me, but would always say she liked talking to me, which confused my autistic brain and made me think she actually did like me and just had a bad day. She would casually bring up information about herself and then get paranoid when I would bring it up, calling me a stalker.\n\nOne time, she said she liked Gilmore Girls, that it was her favorite show. I said something about Gilmore Girls and she said \"How do you know I like Gilmore Girls? I never brought it up. Are you a stalker?\" and then she would be like \"Relax, I'm joking\". So, of course, being me, I thought she was someone who joked often.\n\nHowever, Emma yelled at me, called me subhuman, and told me they were the only ones who would ever care about me. \"No one else will,\" she said. She said that she didn't care about how I felt and that it was my fault because everyone hated me and I was autistic.

I guess you could call the environment of people \"popular\" but personally i don't like putting that label on people. This invitation was around 11 PM at night and i was on my way home when Ben told me to turn around and go with him to the party. I told him i had to go home and sleep because i had church in the morning and that he would have to go alone. Ben is *interesting* to say the least because I know he would talk about how he regrets not going to the party if he didn't go. So I started nudging him towards going to the party with my other friend Thomas who was in the car. Later when I got home Ben started getting cold feet about going and I admittedly was aggressive and took it to far when trying to convince him to go to the party.\n\n  \nI didn't insult him I was just a bit too passionate about him going because I know he would regret it if he doesn't. Our whole 5 friend group wouldn't hear the end of it. The girls that invited him and I are nice and I tried telling Ben that he wouldn't be alone at the party. He still didn't want to go. Once it started getting too far Thomas who was in the car with me texted me all mad. He said that I was being too overboard with trying to convince Ben and that I shouldn't be too overboard because he gets super subconscious and was worried about all sorts of stuff. Ben was worried about was him getting noticed, not fitting in, being alone, etc. We took this to the group chat and Ben started clapping back, stating that no one in the friend group would go into the party if they were in the situation and called out me for being manipulative. Looking back I was being too aggressive about it. That night I went to dms to apologize and said he should just go home and not worry about it anymore since he was losing his mind over this situation. BTW he was outside the house that the party was being held at. Later the whole group chat blew up and everyone started getting heated. I started getting flamed alongside one of my other friends Mike who was also being too aggressive towards Ben. I apologized to everyone and we let the argument just sit. \n\nIn the morning I woke up and found out in the group chat that Ben went to the party, got us all invitations to the next one, and was like \"ur welcome i hate you all\". He said he was just joking in the group chat but he hasn't spoken to me since that night and has left me on read. This is the part that I don't get.

So, I was unable to attend the funeral.\n\nLess than a month ago, I had found my old recipe book that had gone missing 8 years prior during a move.

Over the years, I tried getting the recipe again from her and other family members, but none of them tasted the same.\n\nWhen I found my book and read the recipe, I realized that the reason none of them were the same was because I had written it in her kitchen as we made it together.

It is always crowded (coffee shop noise helps me focus), so I show up at opening time (8am), order some food and a drink, and stay for 2-3 hours. The layout is mostly 2 person tables that can be pushed together, with some larger tables as well as counter seating. Even though I go on my own, I always sit at a 2 person table, as the counters are uncomfortable for me and they do not have much space. I also like sitting against the wall so that people walking by can’t see my computer screen.\n\nYesterday at \\~9am, I was doing work at a table when a random woman sat across from me. This ticked me off because I don’t like my personal space being invaded, and I would have appreciated it if she had asked me before sitting down, but I ignored it. I was near the counter that day, so she might have just been waiting for her food. As I looked up, I noticed she was talking to another woman in the line to order (we’ll call the first woman Beatrice and the second woman Suzy). Suzy was saying how they might have to take their food to go because no tables were available. Beatrice didn’t address me directly, but she gestured to me, as if planning to take over my table. This ticked me off more because it was like I was an object that could be moved, but I knew when the time came I would ask them not to sit at my table.\n\nSure enough, Suzy got the order in and brought her number to my table. She then asked if I wouldn’t mind moving to the counters so that her friend could sit here, saying her friend had recently had back surgery and the counters would be too uncomfortable for her. I told her no–the counters are uncomfortable for me too, and there would not be enough space for all of my books and notebooks. She called me rude and inconsiderate and said I shouldn’t even be there because I wasn’t eating anything. I said I had bought breakfast and a drink, not that it was their business, and that they could take things to go. Eventually, one of the workers came over and asked if they were bothering me. I said they were, and Beatrice and Suzy were asked to leave.\n\nWhen I got home, I recounted the story to my roommate. I thought she would be as horrified as I was by their behavior, but she was hesitant to take a side. She said their behavior was rude and entitled, but at the same time I was taking up a table at a notoriously busy cafe for a long time and I could have moved. Later, my sister likened it to not giving up a seat to a disabled person on public transit. This I don’t agree with because transportation is a NEED for a lot of people, and these people didn’t NEED to sit down at this café. Also, maybe this is asshole-y of me, but I think a lot of people say they have back issues or some other mild condition just to get things they want. Both my sister and my roommate said it was a “they had to BE there” kind of situation for them to decide, so I’m wondering if any of you can decide if I’m TA without having been there?", "assistant": "NTA.

Two years ago, this friend of his suddenly became a significant part of his life. They live together for a lot of the year, my brother always talks about him when they’re not together, and his friend is always hanging around for the rest of the year when he’s living with our parents, even though he lives pretty far away. Everyone thinks they’re a couple. My mum asked me about it, after my sister had mentioned it to her, and I'd already assumed. My brother hasn’t had many girlfriends, and his friend seems gay. To me, the ultimate “proof” was that his phone’s wallpaper used to be a pic of them together, and when my mum asked about where they were in it, he acted cagey and changed it. They're very affectionate and my brother acts like a different person with him. \n\nOur parents include his friend like they do my fiancée and our younger sister's boyfriend. Mum is worried that he hasn’t come out because he feels unaccepted, so she's made an effort to be inclusive. I personally don't believe they're together anymore after my brother told me a story about a bad date he went on. I like his friend and I think he’s nice, but he’s a lot. He’s always shown up every time he’s invited, and he’s loud and chatty. I know he wouldn’t mix well with my fiancée’s more traditional family based on his personality. Her parents are paying for the wedding too. We've invited family only, with partners counting, and we invited my brother and his friend together under the impression that the friend counted under “partner.” It’s very feasible for us to rescind our invitation to him so we did, I just told my brother it’s not fair to other guests that can’t just grab a mate and bring them too. His friend doesn’t work so it’s not like we imposed. My brother asked why I couldn’t just make an exception for him, and I said that wasn't fair. He asked if teenagers dating count as \"partners\" (because my sister's boyfriend is invited) and he told me to \"just admit I don't like\" his friend, which isn't true. I made the mistake of saying that he wouldn't have had a good time with my fiancée's family anyway, which made my brother say we have ulterior motives to uninviting him (again, not true).\n\nI get friendships are important and I don’t mean to devalue that, but we’re not having friends as plus-ones and my fiancée and I don't feel like we’re losing anything by not having him. My fiancée even says it's a relief because of her family. But I do feel bad for my brother, and I feel like this is casting a shadow over things when I do ultimately like his friend. My mum and sister have been treating me like I’m the devil for this because they believe they’re in a relationship and I’m being unfair to him, too. I’d feel less bad if I didn’t invite him at all, but the more I think about it, going out of my way to rescind the invitation seems like a shitty thing to do. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA simply for inviting and then rescinding your guest’s invitation.  That’s plain rude.\n\nBut then the deeper issue is that you uninvited the guy everyone pretty much knows is your brother’s partner because your fiancé’s family is “traditional”.

Before they came, I asked if they wanted any food or drinks to have in the house and I told them what we normally kept stocked in the house. They didn’t make any requests. \n\nThe first morning the girlfriend wanted coffee. I told her we did not have any way to make coffee here, but I could bring her to the coffee shop which was 2 minutes away. She declined but her mood seemed sour after that. We hung out with other mutual friends for the day and I learned from one of them that she was really upset we didn’t have a way to make coffee at home because she needs it in the morning. Each morning I offered to bring her to the coffee shop and she always declined. I even offered it as my treat in case they didn’t have the money. She declined still. \n\nWell they came over again a year later. I still didn’t have a coffee maker because we don’t drink coffee.

(16F)\n\nAll I can remember is that my mother always told me I lie too much. It really hurt, because the one thing both I and my friends value about me is my honesty. I’m not pretending I’m perfect I’m a teenager, and of course there have been times where it was much easier to get out of a situation with a easy lie. \n\nGrowing up whenever I did something wrong instead of getting yelled at bc I messed it up I was accused of lying.Ex: when I was 8, I tried ironing clothes and obviously did a bad job, because I was literally a child, and when my mom saw it she yelled at me for lying about doing it at all Similar things happened with laundry, chores, or even just when I came home from school. Every single time, it was thrown at me that I must be the one who did it, because “no one else in the house would do that type of behavior.”\n\nThere were also small situations, like not unpacking my schoolbag after school or sport practice because I simply forgot. When they asked why, I said the truth that I forgot. I know everyone says that as an excuse, but in my case I really did forget small things a lot. Instead of believing, They told me I was lazy and “lying again.”\n\nThis kept happening for years, to the point where I actually started catching myself lying about little pointless things like where i was or what I was doing w my friends when we hanged out things that didn’t really matter. I don’t know why I did it. Every time I feelt awful about myself, because it’s like I’ve become exactly what they always told I was. Maybe I’ve always been a liar and just didn’t want to admit it.:(\n\nIt hurts though, because I get told almost every single day, or in every interaction I have w my mother that I can’t be trusted, that nobody can count on me bc Im a *lying bitch*. But it’s only my close family  (mother and brother) saying this.(I once complained to my father about this and he just sought it off)  Outside of my family, nobody calls me a liar. And the confusing part is, I don’t lie about important or significant things or about something that would seriously affect anyone. But in my family, even when I swear up and down that I’m telling the truth, they will not believe me. They haven’t trusted me for like 6 years now.\n\nI don’t know what to do. How do I rebuild trust when I don’t even understand where I lost it? Am I really the problem here?

I was taught ASL and my mom and others in my family learned ASL too. This is the only way I could ever speak or be spoken to. I don't lip read or anything like that. My dad wasn't in my life ever. And when I was 9 my mom started dating Tom. Tom had a 10 year old son, Cole, at the time. It was pretty clear from the start that Cole was unenthusiastic about us and had no interest in learning ASL to speak to me. Tom and mom decided we should all take \"family\" ASL classes and learn together in a fun environment, which the classes they found were. Cole had to be dragged and he didn't take part willingly or eagerly. If anything he'd intentionally do things wrong and make himself do worse than he would have naturally so he was asked less.\n\nHe did eventually take them seriously. My mom believed it was because he had really bonded with me and now gave a crap about communicating with me. But that wasn't it. He had a knew kid in school he wanted to talk to who was also deaf. The new guy was his motivation for learning. Cole and I never talked enough for him to be motivated to learn and he made lots of mistakes when talking to me but I noticed his ASL was perfect with his friend.\n\nIt always felt weird living with someone who didn't want me around. My mom and Tom believed we'd blended eventually. I think there was some fight when Cole turned 17 and my mom and Tom wanted to go away for a weekend.

My mom has asked a few times if we've met up or whatever and I'm always honest and say no. She finally asked me two or three weeks ago if things were good between Cole and me and I told her she had to have picked up on the fact he never wanted us around and wasn't interested in being good between him and me. She said she really believed that had changed once we got closer and she brought up how he took ASL more seriously. I told her it was clearly for his friend. Not me. She was clearly shocked. But brought it up again over the weekend and she told me she thought I was very naive to think Cole didn't learn ASL for both and that him being resistant at first didn't mean he didn't grow to love me. I told her she was the naive one to expect him to magically change out of nowhere. I told her if she wanted to be married to Tom that badly, it's fine.

His ex is remarried to her wife (48F), who has become extremely involved in the co-parenting dynamic.\n\nThey have been divorced for eight years when my husband's ex-wife left him for her current wife. I met my husband almost six years ago, we married earlier this year. \n\nFrom the beginning, I’ve tried to be polite and respectful when interacting with his ex-wife and her wife, but over time, I’ve grown to avoid any direct contact with them, especially his ex-wife's wife. Every time I do engage, she finds a way to talk down to me or make passive-aggressive comments—both to my face and indirectly through the kids.\n\nFor example, she’ll say things like, “I'm surprised you're here, with you it's always hit or miss,” or, “we're too old for what you do.” She’s also made snide remarks about how I am not good with the kids “you can always ask me questions as I know how to parent them.”\n\nThe kids have picked up on it, too. They’ve mentioned things like, “stepmom says you don’t really know how kids because you don't have any,” or, “stepmom and mom said you’re only involved because Dad needs help.” It’s incredibly frustrating, especially because I’ve made every effort to build a good relationship with the kids and respect their boundaries.\n\nI finally decided that for my own sanity, I’m done trying to engage with her. I still talk to my husband’s ex-wife when necessary, but I won’t involve myself with her wife anymore. Of course, this hasn’t gone unnoticed. Now, the ex-wife and her wife are accusing me of being “inappropriate” and “difficult” because I won’t speak to her or coordinate directly with her. They insist that her involvement is “necessary” and that I’m not prioritizing what’s best for the kids.\n\nBut here’s the thing: I’m not refusing to co-parent. I’m refusing to subject myself to someone who consistently disrespects me and undermines my role in the kids’ lives. My husband agrees with me, but I’m still questioning whether I’m doing the right thing for the kids by drawing this line.\n\nAdditionally, I am pregnant and this is causing me great stress. The ex-wife is already creating conflict with my husband every chance she gets. She interferes with our custodial time every week and constantly berats him in the parenting app they use to communicate. \n\nAITA for refusing to talk to his ex-wife’s wife?", "assistant": "NTA.   \nSounds wise to go low/ no contact with them, they aren’t co parenting, they are bullying. \n\nAlso consider getting a mediated parenting plan that is legally tied up properly.   \nAnd a parenting communication app… so everyone communicates through the court ordered app and it notes tone and insults. Will sort a lot of the nonsense out. \n\nWhile you are at it… get the kids into some kind of therapy, and warn the therapist that the ex/ex’s wife are warming up alienation and you want a good relationship with your step kids and can the therapist help facilitate this."}

My bridal party is my sister (MOH), my two younger siblings, and my best friend (25F). My best friend is a teacher and often struggles financially. She has mentioned more than once how expensive weddings can be. I really don’t want to be the kind of bride who expects people to spend a lot just to be part of my day, so I added her dress, hair, and makeup into my budget. My parents are paying for most of the wedding, which I know is a privilege, and I want to spread the wealth and make this as stress-free as possible for the people closest to me.\n\nWhen we were looking at dresses, she pointed out they were expensive (around $200). I told her I understood but that I’d like her to have a dress she actually loves and might wear again, instead of wasting money on a plain one she’ll never touch again. I’ve casually mentioned a few times that I’d like to pay for it, but she brushes it off every time. She’s very proud and doesn’t usually take gifts well.\n\nShe also tends to be critical of people with money. For example, she’s baffled by how her boyfriend’s well-off family spends theirs and often calls them privileged. I think she might be taking my offer the wrong way, like I’m bragging or showing off, but that’s not my intention at all. I just don’t want her stressed or forced to find a “good enough” dress that fits her budget when I could easily help.\n\nYesterday she came over again to look at dresses. When I mentioned paying for hers, she flat-out refused and said it was silly for me to even consider it. I didn’t push back, but I honestly just want her to feel good in something she loves without stressing about the price tag. I’m sitting on money specifically budgeted for this, and it feels silly to let her struggle when I could help. I would also never say this to her face, but I would prefer to pay for a nicer dress, than have her stress and get a not as nice dress and have to stand next to my siblings who are wearing a more heightened style. \n\nSo AITA for wanting to pay for my best friend’s bridesmaid dress even though she keeps refusing? Should I just drop it, stand my ground, or offer to split the cost with her?", "assistant": "NAH\n\nAnd people saying NTA seem to be forgetting that means the bridesmaid is being TA.

Making friends doesn't come easy to me and I really only have 2 close friends. 3 if you count my best friend's childhood friend that hangs out with us sometimes. My twin is very social and has a bigger group of friends that he hangs out with all the time since most of them go to the same college. \n\nLast week when we were hanging out with some of our mutual friends from highschool one of them made a comment about my shirt, saying it looked like one my brother had in highschool. I told her it was the same shirt and she gave me a kind of weird look. I brushed it off because I didn't think she meant anything by it. My brother and I sometimes share clothes because we have a similar enough style and are about the same height and build. For us it just means we have a lot more clothing options. \n\nYesterday, I ran into that same friend after one of my classes and we stopped to talk. My brother called me in the middle of our conversation to ask if I wanted food since he was ordering anyway and before I hung up I said \"Bye, I love you.\" He said it back and my friend gave me a strange look. She didnt say anything at first but then when I asked her what was wrong she said it was just strange that I said I love you to my brother. I laughed it off and asked her if she didnt say it to her siblings. She said no because that was weird. \n\nI didn't know what to say so I just left it there and told her I needed to go so I could meet J at home before he left for his friends house since they were planning on hanging out. She then started talking about how weird our relationship was and how it wasn't normal for siblings to share clothes or say i love you, hug, hang out so much or do any of the things we do. And how highchool was weird since we were always together and talking to eachother. \n\nShe also brought up a comment I made in highschool In response to a question about what I woud do if my twin died. I said that I didn't think I could live without him because he was a part of me. This question was asked to another set of twins we were friends with and they both had the same answer. \n\nThe whole time she was going on, i just stared at her because I really couldnt believe what I was hearing.

I was 3 when their marriage ended. They share custody 50-50 of me still. For as long as I can remember mom has always blamed dad for it and said he cheated. My dad never said anything. He refuses to badmouth mom. But I know he really dislikes her. My grandma (dad's mom) told me mom was the one who cheated and she's the one who even got pregnant with someone else's child and had an abortion to try and conceal it, that dad had asked her directly and suddenly she was no longer pregnant (this was after me).\n\nI can't know the truth obviously. But I lean more in favor of my dad.\n\nThe reason? My mom remarried when I was like 5 and she has tried so many times to push dad out and get her new husband in. She has lied to the kids she has with her husband and told them he's our dad and when I go for a week, it's to some \"uncle\" and I mistakenly think he's my dad. So I have half siblings who'll refer to my mom's husband as \"our dad\" and they'll step in to correct me when I call him by his first name. I usually end up correcting them and around and around we go.\n\nI dislike my mom's husband. I think he really wants me to accept him and let him take over from dad but he never stops to listen when I say I love my dad and it upsets me when they talk shit about him. He always tells me I should have him instead of dad at Father's Day activities. This was worse when I was younger and that stuff was more there. He'd always try to get me to go to Father/Daughter dances with them (including purity ones which eww). And he'd get annoyed when I'd say no. He'd tell me he puts so much work into me and I should return the effort.\n\nMy dad tried to get custody from the judge at my request, we were in court literally weeks ago, but the judge said I need to continue 50/50 until I'm 18 and if either parent attempts to prevent that then the other will get full custody of me.\n\nSo I'm stuck here and my half siblings, the older they get, the more annoying they are about correcting me and then I correct them too. I told them the other day that their dad isn't my dad and I don't even like their dad or love their dad. My mom heard and she told me I need to stop correcting them and they just love me so much they want me to be their full sister and I'm being a bully to them correcting them all the time.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA. Not even close to it.\n\n\"she told me I need to stop correcting them\"\n\nWell, there's one super duper easy way she can achieve that: Tell her kids the truth. Because honestly, while your half siblings can't help it, this'll make you resent them as well because they keep trying to correct you based on what they think is the truth."}

This started at least a year ago when I bought him the game on the PS4, where he would start getting merchandise of this said character;for example, pins, stickers, t-shirts, etc. He talks about the character non-stop sometimes, giving an analysis about the character, and if anyone says something about it, he will continue with his tangent even more. My husband and I have found it incredibly annoying, but we've stayed silent because we don't want to shut him down or hurt his feelings. He got a costume of him and has wore it in public, despite me going against the idea of him wearing it on casual occasions that aren't like Halloween or a party, but he still does anyway. He even started mimicking some his personality traits.\n\nI didn't mind as much when it was small things like this, but the more time does by the morning his behavior starts to go more extreme. He’s constantly copies Kokichi's script lines in conversations, which makes it hard for us to have a normal dialogue without him breaking out in some annoying annoying voiceline of his. Overtime room is covered in posters related to the character, and he has had his phone case, and lock screen and homescreen as this character.\n\nTrust me when I say I tried to be patient, but I really couldn't when he began mimicking Kokichi's more problematic traits, like being extremely manipulative and disrespectful. When I confronted him about this and expressed that it was negatively affecting his behavior and our family dynamic, I ended up taking out all of my stress that I bottled up over the time and I ended up yelling. I told him that he needs to stop idolizing a character who promotes such negative traits and start focusing more on his real life and relationships instead of being stuck in this delusional phase of his. \n\nHe was really hurt by my reaction and ended up shutting down and gone back to his room. Now it's been 2 days since that conversation  and now it feels like I attacked something he genuinely loves and finds comforting.\n\nI told some of my loved ones about this. My sister and husband thinks I overreacted and should have approached the situation more calmly, while my dad and sister's husband believe I was right to address the issue before it escalated further. While others think I should've stayed silent and just waited for his phase to end eventually, I genuinely don't know how to process this situation and my son hasn't really talked as much as he usually does since then. Am I the asshole? How should I process this?", "assistant": "YTA stop letting kids have access to Danganronpa actually"}

I believe the girl is 18 or 19. In our country and particularly our city, housekeepers are in very high demand, especially ones from the same region of our country as Vivian is because they have the best food in the country.\n\nMy brother got divorced a year ago and got very depressed, so I advised him to hire a housekeeper to help him maintain his daily tasks. She also helps him by babysitting his two daughters when it is his custody time when he is at work. \n\nI went grocery shopping a few weeks ago with my brother and he picked up a box of chocolates and some flowers for Vivian. He told me that she was sick and I thought it was very sweet of him. \n\nHowever, my nieces (my brothers daughters) told me that their father always hits on Vivian when she is working and he buys her expensive gifts. Then yesterday, he made an off handed comment about her body when she was bringing some foot to the table when I went to his home to have lunch with him. She laughed awkwardly and excused herself.\n\nI asked him what he was doing and basically, he is attracted to her. I told him that his behaviour with her was not appropriate as he is her employer and if he cannot behave, he should let her go. When he hired her, her agency said that there were many other families who wanted her because of resume so she will not be left jobless. I told him that she deserves to have a work place that is safe. \n\nHe was very upset and said I was treating him like a creep and it wasn’t my business. I left after this and he called me demanding an apology. I feel like I may have over stepped since he told me Vivian has not complained herself. I feel very bad now and I was wondering if I am AH.", "assistant": "NTA. You did the right thing here. Vivian is young and might not be comfortable complaining to him. Just because she hasn't doesn't make his behavior appropriate and since his daughters have also noticed it it becomes even more of a situation."}

After waiting in line, I went to the sauce dispensers to get some mustard. I saw a child licking her fingers, eating the sauce off them, and then proceeding to wipe them on the sauce dispensers (where the sauce comes out), repeating the same thing several times with all three sauce dispensers.\n\nI decided not to confront the child or say anything to her family to avoid causing drama and embarrassing the child. Instead, I told the staff about the incident. A staff member came out and asked who did it, and I pointed at the child. Probably should’ve kept quiet, but oh well.\n\nThe staff member confronted the family, which was a big group with two women and their children of various ages. The child who did this was about 6-7 years old (I saw her licking everything around her and even her mother asked her to stop). The family then confronted me, asking why I didn’t tell them directly and went straight to the staff. I politely explained that my concern was food safety and that’s all, so I wasn’t looking to confront anyone.\n\nThey didn’t believe me, said I must hate children, and spent the next few minutes talking over me and not letting me put a word in. I reiterated that my concern was only food safety and that I don’t want other people’s saliva in my sauces. The staff member then told them they could easily check the CCTV, which seemed to calm the family down.\n\nI’m still frustrated due to the whole incident.

The staff should’ve handled this very discreetly so that nobody knew who it was that reported their child, that would’ve saved a confrontation altogether"}

Or actually I will start with my wife \"Tara\". Tara is lovely and wonderful. Tara also escaped from her little midwestern hometown and ran to the coast the absolute moment that she could, and I am pretty sure her mom took that personally. (her mom was born and raised in and around that small town)\n\nSo my MIL. She is emotionally immature. Tara read that one book about immature adult parents and she finally understood her family dynamic in a way she never did before. MIL is not a bad or evil person, she usually means very well, but she's kind of, I don't know how to put it, self-centered? Like her first thought process is always \"how do I feel about this new information\".\n\nTara and I bought a little starter home last year (fuck interest rates but we're hoping they come down and we can refinance, the place was too good to pass up) and her MIL invited herself over last week. This is something that is extremely on brand for her, and we like to pick our battles in this family, so we just let her. \n\nHer mom (who again is not terrible, just has bad emotional regulation and boundaries) shows up and drops her stuff in the spare room and just immediately starts giving herself the tour. Again, whatever, we actually hired a cleaner before she arrived so we wouldn't worry, annoying but that's life.\n\nSo she's wandering around and comes to our bedroom. I have a jumbo sized tub of generic vaseline next to my bed because I use a nose CPAP and my lips get chapped so she picks it up and makes this really weird face and says, almost direct quote, \"well I know what THIS is for!\" And I respond, \"oh that's for chapped lips, I don't jerk off with vaseline.\"\n\nApparently my timing was good because my wife laughed but my MIL did not laugh at all. Then for the next three days she kept asking me ARE YOU GONNA BE GROSS AGAIN when I tried to make normal conversation. I said over and over that she was the one who made the joke and her response was always \"yeah but that was a JOKE!\" like what I said was totally serious? And I guess it was, I mean, I was telling the truth, but I was only bantering because she started it. I didn't even invite her into our bedroom.\n\nAnyways she brought it up over text to Tara and there is subtle pressure from her to just apologize, but I don't think I did anything wrong.

(My mother was never in my life, this was her way to \"make things right\".)  \nI moved there in June and found a job that I could do part-time while going to school full-time.\n\nWe are from a small town with only an elementary school and the closest high school had a bad reputation and takes 45 minutes with the school bus.  \nLuckily for my (step)sister (16f) who graduated from elementary school, was accepted to a nice high school in the city, as she had pretty good grades. Her options were to live in a dormitory or with me in my apartment, as it is walking distance from her school, and even tho this apartment is not very big, it has 2 bedrooms.\n\nMy stepmother (sister's real mother) and father agreed that that was the best idea, and I agreed because even without rent the bills from the apartment were high enough to be pretty good junk from my salary from the part-time job.\n\nFirst things were nice, as we usually get along nicely with my sister, but in the first school week she found some new friends and it turned out to be annoying for me.  \nShe started to arrive home late and often smelled like alcohol and cigarettes, I told her that I couldn't fall asleep without knowing where she was.\n\nThe last drop was last Wednesday, I arrived from work at 10 in the evening and she was nowhere, I sent her messages asking where she was and no reply, she appeared home at 5 in the morning - and did not sleep a moment.  \nI told our parents, that I couldn't live like that and my father told me \"Don't you remember when you were this age\" and \"You will also have kids one day\" - and I said that why not, but I didn't want to worry about kids today.  \n  \nI called the dormitory on Friday and asked if they had a vacancy and they did! I sent them all my sister's information and told them that our parents would sign everything on Monday.  \nWhen she went to visit her parents on the weekend, I took all her stuff, loaned a car from my friend and took her stuff to our parent's place and told them, that I couldn't do it anymore and she could live in a dormitory, she has a place there. (Demand for High school student dormitories is not too high, lucky me.)\n\nMy father was pissed and told me that I am an asshole for making my sister live in the dormitory.  \nSister cried and said she did not want to share a room with some stranger.  \nI know she also hates the fact, that the dormitory has strict rules including curfew.  \nOnly my stepmother shrugged and told me that it was my sister's own fault she did not listen to me.\n\nI feel like my sister hoped that living with his older brother was her chance to have freedom, but I feel responsible for her.  \nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA \n\nYou’re not the a-hole. You took on a huge responsibility by allowing your sister to live with you while she attended high school, and it’s clear you wanted to help her out. However, she took advantage of that arrangement, breaking curfews and making you worry about her safety. As a 19-year-old who is also managing full-time school and part-time work, it’s unreasonable for your family to expect you to handle the role of a full-time guardian.\n\nYour sister's behavior showed that she wasn’t ready for the freedom of living away from home. Moving her to a dormitory, which has more structure and rules, is a reasonable decision. You tried to set boundaries and express your concerns, but they weren't respected. This situation isn’t about being her parent but about needing a living environment where you can focus on your own responsibilities and well-being.\n\nYour stepmother seems to understand the consequences of your sister's actions, which suggests that she, at least, recognizes your right to make this decision. It’s unfortunate your sister is upset, but this could be an important learning experience for her.\n\nYou’re not an AH for wanting a living situation that works for both of you, and the dormitory might actually be a better fit for her needs at this point in her life."}

We all like her; she is super nice. I am getting married next April and sent an invite to my brother's apartment. We decided to send invites to households and not individuals. For example, our aunt received an invite for her family and not for each individual.\n\nLast Thursday, we met at my parents' place. It was just the core family because of some tax reasons, lol. While there, I asked my brother about Lia's dietary restrictions. I know that she is a vegetarian for health reasons and that she cannot have certain raw vegetables.\n\nHe said that she wasn't going to come and that he was taking his girl best friend, Amanda, instead. Now, their relationship is weird af. Amanda has always been stringing my brother along, in my opinion. He always denies having feelings for her, but let's be real here.\n\nAmanda would date other guys, blow off my brother, then when things were on the decline with her partners, she would be attached to him again. Her last boyfriend broke up with her right around the time my brother, his then ex-girlfriend, Amanda, and her ex were supposed to travel to Spain. What did my idiot brother do? Go with Amanda alone because Amanda was uncomfortable with his ex-girlfriend. Obviously, he acted blindsided when his girlfriend broke up with him. I didn't even say anything anymore because it's all so weird.\n\nSo, when he said that, I asked if Lia already had other plans. But my brother said that Amanda had asked if she could come because it would be an opportunity to finally see the old gang (we were in the same friend group in high school). I told him that I would have invited Amanda if I wanted her there. Amanda is mean and cold. She always makes disparaging comments about other girls. At every event, around one hour in, she will make some sort of scene that either has her running away crying or sitting mad at a table telling everyone to \"leave her alone\" and then making a cryptic comment about something \"hurting her.\"\n\nI told my brother I was revoking his plus one and Amanda was NOT coming to our wedding. He accused me of being misogynistic and bigoted because I don't understand opposite-sex friendships. Which is BS. My husband has a female childhood friend who is his best woman. I love her too and she has been amazing. AND SHE RESPECTS FUCKING BOUNDARIES. She always includes me and made a huge effort when I started dating my fiancé to integrate me into the friend group.\n\nAnyway, I said my decision was final. He could take it or leave it, but I would be inviting Lia myself because I like her. He screamed at me and told me to keep out of his business. I said to get rid of his weird fucking feelings for Amanda.\nHe is mad at me. My dad said is none of our deal. My mom is furious with my brother. So Aita?\n\n\nEdit: to answer some questions \n\nThe invite was addressed to the \"smith's.\" Funnily enough, Lia had the same last name as us. Granted, we have one of the most common last names.\n\nYes, they live together.\n\n\nThe tax thing is nothing huge. My parents have a small buisness but are really bad at keeping track of all their receipts. So every month we go and help them. We digitalis the receipts and put them in a bookkeeping software for the accountant\n\n\n*Amanda is in the comments. Say hi!*", "assistant": "NTA; primarily because you say you intentionally did NOT invite Amanda and that you two no longer get along, despite previously sharing a friend group. \n\nHe doesn’t get to bring someone intentionally not invited to your wedding. Unfortunately you can’t control his obsession with Amanda and he likely has to keep destroying relationships before he finally gets that he is prioritizing her over his relationships."}

And I realize I sound just like a women moaning (and the women I'm with will be making similar sounds).  I've had some women tell me it's a turnoff.  Thing is, I can't really get into sex 100% and just let myself go without it.  Many of my partners have mentioned it and its embarassing.

One tried to get me dressed/made up like a girl since I sounded like one (she was kinky).\n\nNeedless to say, it's embarassing. I feel like when I'm going to expose myself as vulnerable during sex, I should feel comfortable being me.  But, it makes things awkward.

It's not realistic to say that there aren't any talented minorites, which is low-key what people are really saying when they wont recognize this. \n\nSince we are spoonfed white actors and white stories there's nothing wrong with specifically putting spotlight on not-white stories - you can't change the racist status quo if you don't force it.

I will get back to everyone --\n\nStill working through the comments.. the last few days had me feeling down and not myself then I decided to post this. I wasn't expecting to read through so many encouraging words, teary-eyed stories, and feel the strength of so many ambitious women. Thank you all for taking the time to share your thoughts and motivations.", "assistant": "Incredibly lonely. As a (26, F)  premed student applying next year, I decided to finish up my prerequisites and seriously consider medical school 2 years ago. I had to move to to the opposite end of the country for the program I wanted and having to make new friends and loose old ones was incredibly difficult and isolating, still is. Dating has also been a challenge because finding a man who I'm in alignment with in terms of career aspirations and future plans is a huge challenge. If I do date it can only be super casual and fleeting because I can't commit to anything romantic for too long, my medical school plans always come first, non-negotiable. I don't have time to text all day and share memes and spend time with a boyfriend, and  I don't want to make decisions about where to apply to medical school based on where my partner is geographically. I've also had to come to terms with the fact that I'll be a geriatric mother when i'm finally ready to be a parent and this will come with it's own set of challenges.\n\nHOWEVER: I do not regret making the decisions I've made. As a Black Immigrant woman who didn't necessarily excel in sports, I always knew my ticket out of poverty and into a meaningful life full of abundance would be my education. Once I found my love for science and healthcare that passion was unstoppable.  No matter how hard this journey gets I still focus on the positives. I have more gratitude and respect for my educational pursuits, I'm hopeful about the future, and I'm excited for the change I'll be effecting through my efforts when i reach the end. I'm positive that eventually when all is said and done I'll find my tribe and the lovers of my life and eventually settle down. But I want it to happen at the right time when i feel stable and I've laid down the necessary foundations.\n\nYou are right where you need to be, you are not alone. Focus on the good, there is plenty. This is a great time to date casually or just be alone and explore the joys of solitude. Self-actualization comes with sacrifices but you get to decide what mentality you'll have. Conscious Positivism, Resilience and Agility are needed to get you where you are headed but please allow yourself time to also grieve your old life and the people you had to and will have to let go of along this journey."}

I'm talking about stating in a matter-of-fact manner to a girl I just met that I think she has a nice figure. \n\nEDIT: I have to go to work, but let me summarize what I've learned so far. \n\n* Women don't like being complimented on their appearance, because that means I'm not focusing on \"who they are.\" \n* Women don't feel safe in their own home, much less anywhere else, so I should respect that by never approaching them.\n* Women don't advertise their figure *for me*. It's for someone else, apparently. \n* It's bad to comment on a \"personal thing,\" even if I'm complimenting that personal attribute. So I should never tell a girl that I think she's smart, sexy, athletic, etc., because that would be touching on something \"personal.\" We all know how much people hate being told they're smart.", "assistant": "This could be a nice compliment from someone I know, but would not be appreciated from someone I don't.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskWomen. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Are women romantically and sexually attracted to men? Essay long serious question from inexperienced nerd guy.\n\nEdit. I put in a TL;DR at the bottom now.\n\nIf you think the title is a joke then no I am just clueless. Quick backstory so you know why I have to post this.\n\nI have been a shut in nerd for over 20 years. The live in mom's basement type. But it is really my room on the upstairs, not a basement, and it is not a basement for my buddies either. Take it from the source.\n\nNext I have never dated much less talked to a non-family member girl for very long. Yes in my whole life. All home schooling, in childhood I was kept away from children because they could have got me into smoking or drinking and crap like that, and I live on online games right now as much as I did the past 10 years.\n\nNext all the women in my family have divorced or otherwise unhappy marriages where they claim to not love or be attracted to him and stay with him for the kids.\n\nLast is the big one. When I say all the women I mean my mother too. We have talked about it in detail and yes I am alive and my siblings are alive not because of sexual, physical, romantic, emotional attraction at all. Wtf? Is this common? Do not think bad of her please. She said she just wanted a family and I am totally sure she isnt a lesbian or bi at all because I asked. And apparently not straight?\n\nNow that you see where I am coming from, hear my plight. From my own learning about the world, women do not seem attracted to men, for the same reasons men such as me are attracted to women. I fantasize about passionate romantic love and someone to come home to and want to spend time and her life with me as much as I do her. I am not strongly sexual. But I know I am not asexual, gay, bi, pan. Sex would do NOTHING for me if it was a one way street. Me being interested hinges on her feeling the same way about me.\n\nRecently I joined okcupid too, a month ago. I did not send any messages yet, please understand baby steps and it took a lot to join. It seems women do not message men on there. And it seems most men just message with sup and are seeking casual sex. These are accurate suspicions you think? Anyways I will definately not meet women IRL. I don't drink and do drugs or go to bars. I don't like the idea honestly of joining a hobby club of a thing like dancing or yoga or things just to meet women as the primary goal. I am not like most men who just want to pick up \"chicks\" and use them.\n\nIt probably is good to mention most of the women I would message on okcupid are listed as bi. I do not know what to make of that, because why would they pick me over a cute girl. Are all women bi a little bit even if they say straight? Sorry to ask that but I am that clueless. I am not Brad Pitt, I am just a guy. Brad Pitt posting this would be real funny though. But yes I am not fat with a disgusting neck beard, I take care of my body, and don't wear fedoras and that crap. But why would I assume that a girl could be physically attracted to me when I have never been told otherwise, and never learned otherwise.\n\nIf you read this far and wonder how to help or what to say at all, let me try to make questions.\n\n1, what do you think of all this. Am I crazy? Or does it make sense for me to feel this unsure. Just because I am attracted to women does not mean I can infer they could be attracted to me.\n\n2, are you romantically attracted to men? Like passionate true love and that crap in the movies. A spark and true feelings as deep for him as he can have for you, instead of ONLY being with a man for life companionship the way you would see a coworker or someone in your military platoon where it is just a job. A team mate in a game if you will, the game of life. A team mate you do not love but you are good at working with even if there are no deep romantic love feelings.\n\n3, are you sexually attracted to men? Physical sexual interest the way I think a girl is cute and I would do anything sexual she asked me, even if it is better if we are in love. And yes then also emotional sexual attraction like sharing the act with your soul mate or \"the one\" if that means anything other than Keanu Reeves. I know I am sexually drawn to women, but less now than younger, but let me tell you puberty was hard sh!t to go through alone in your room. I talked to a couple girls on yahoo messenger teen chats for a few minutes and most or all had boyfriends or girlfriends. I made it a goal to lose virginity before age 14 thinking sex was a big damn deal. Here I am in my middle 20's and much sadder about lonelyness and no love than no sex. :(\n\n4, are you attracted to men in other ways than those 2 ways? Things like life companion, being supported with a house and money, raising children with a man that is fit enough to be not a train wreck father, being protected from other people and things. Though the last one is some ancient instinct from the cavemen era mostly isn't it.\n\n5, I do not think it's bad to be attracted in non love and sex ways from all possibilities in question 4. But, am I correct in guessing some women do not have love or sex attraction and only are attracted for question 4 reasons like child and family raising, or money, or boredom or who the hell knows. If yes is there any way to avoid becoming involved with women like that. I am deathly afraid of being used by someone I would fall in love with and they lack any love or attraction for me. Scared enough that if I dont make baby steps like this post and okcupid account, I can be a movie subject like the 40 year old virgin.\n\n6, if you read this far then thank you for dealing with my confusion. Is there any other way or things you can explain that would help with my fears besides these questions? They are just some big questions I don't know any answer to, at least answers I believe deep down, but I am all ears with learning anything you girls can tell me or link me. I will read all comments and any linked material to anything.\n\nPlease if you reply just read this part, I do not need to be told I am hopeless, and a moron, and that of course I a heterosexual man cannot see why anyone would want to be with a man, or that individual women answering cannot help me and that I should instead seek professional help from a therapist and those guys. They would waste my time I feel, and I don't want to talk to guys who are paid to give me an answer like \"women are attracted to men obviously because of biology unless they are lesbian\", and what would they tell me that women in here actually interested in helping with this post and my issues could not do. Everything there is to know in life, everyone has to learn somewhere and in their own way remember.\n\nMan I hope this isn't deleted because I spent 3 hours on it and honest to God not asking for dating and relationship advice, or medical help. And I don't think I broke other rules like I am not a misogynist. I am very intrigued by and just confused by women and obviously or so I hope it's obvious, very very inexperienced, and curious. Maybe I seem very creepy, or sexist or some crap. But trust me I would never hurt a girl physically or emotionally. I am the annoying inexperienced chivalrous white knight behind the computer screen with all his online RPG buddies and no girls in our guild. No I didn't scare them off. At least I don't think I did because I don't talk to girls even in games lol. :(\n\nI love anonymity so I can if people reply potentially learn things in a non embarrassing way since I can use a throw away account. Damn long post though sorry for telling my life story but I figured it would shed light on why I am earnestly asking the questions that I am.\n\nTL;DR. Women in my family including mother say no sex or love, just other reasons to marry. I was home schooled and only play online games with other guys for the extent of my social life. I have built up many fears and because of my life so far I have not convinced myself a girl can love me the way I feel I would love her in romantic and emotional way, and that she could be sexually and physically attracted to me the way I am to her. I am scared of being used in any way like a throw away husband for providing anything from money to children. I do not want anything close to prostitution ever and I am morally against that \"profession.\" I am also confused if all women are bi even if they say straight and if so why would they pick me over a girl. I feel that advice from real women and answers to these life long questions will help more than referring me to \"professional help\" which sorry but in this case I feel would be a waste of my time and money to talk to someone about.", "assistant": "Your post both broke my heart and made me want to shake you a little bit, so you're getting a detailed reply.\n\n>Recently I joined okcupid too, a month ago.

And it seems most men just message with sup and are seeking casual sex. These are accurate suspicions you think? \n\nSome women do message men on there; a lot of men message pretty short shitty messages that aren't worth responding to. OkC should no be the only place you try.\n\n>Anyways I will definately not meet women IRL. I don't drink and do drugs or go to bars. I don't like the idea honestly of joining a hobby club of a thing like dancing or yoga or things just to meet women as the primary goal. \n\nOk, but what about trying some hobbies other than video games alone in your room so that you can broaden your horizons, learn more about the real world, or make some friends, including girl friends? You need some points of reference outside of movies and your family. Neither are representative of reality. And spoiler: I am attracted to men, but I wouldn't want to date a man who is and wishes to remain as sheltered and devoid of experience as you are right now. Basically, if you cross meeting women in real life off your list of options, you're shooting yourself in the foot so hard it almost looks deliberate.\n\n>I am not like most men who just want to pick up \"chicks\" and use them.\n\nHey, that's pretty harsh on most men. Don't assume most men are somehow worse than you. I get the sense your ideas about men are as vague and distorted and based on cliches and media as your ideas about women, but you may not realise it yet.\n\n>It probably is good to mention most of the women I would message on okcupid are listed as bi. I do not know what to make of that, because why would they pick me over a cute girl. Are all women bi a little bit even if they say straight? \n\nNo. At this juncture I recommend you get on the Scarleteen website and read literally everything.\n\n>But yes I am not fat with a disgusting neck beard, I take care of my body, and don't wear fedoras and that crap. But why would I assume that a girl could be physically attracted to me when I have never been told otherwise, and never learned otherwise.\n\nWell, you haven't made an effort to put yourself in any situations where that might happen. Though, look, it sounds like you've been in a very difficult and kind of fucked up home situation, so I'm more worried for you than acting like it's all your fault or something.\n\n>1, what do you think of all this. Am I crazy? Or does it make sense for me to feel this unsure. Just because I am attracted to women does not mean I can infer they could be attracted to me.\n\nGiven your very odd upbringing and your isolation from women and from various social worlds, it makes sense for you to feel unsure. Especially when you get your understanding of relationships from movies and from dysfunctional families, and when, it sounds like, you've had little opportunity to develop rich and nuanced relationships with your peers, of course you're going to struggle. Plus you're up to your eyeballs in the influence of the dominant culture, which ... http://www.scarleteen.com/article/pink/an_immodest_proposal read this for what you're missing, and what the cultural narratives are missing. \n\n>2, are you romantically attracted to men?\n\nYes. Absolutely and definitely.\n\n>Like passionate true love and that crap in the movies. \n\nNo. To be clear, that's because I think most movies do a poor job of really portraying how love feels to me. It's not in flowers and chocolates or grand gestures and big grandstanding speeches and stupid coincidences and weird manipulations, but in midnight conversations in bed when you reveal everything about yourself to each other, in holding hands and feeling like your home is holding you, in exploring sexual fantasies together and learning things about each other's bodies you never knew before, in holding each other when things are going wrong in your life and you feel like your world is ending.\n\n>A spark and true feelings as deep for him as he can have for you\n\nYes.\n\n>, instead of ONLY being with a man for life companionship the way you would see a coworker or someone in your military platoon where it is just a job. A team mate in a game if you will, the game of life. A team mate you do not love but you are good at working with even if there are no deep romantic love feelings.\n\nI feel both romantic and teammate feelings. I think as relationships go on and acquire layers and history, the initial feelings of infatuation calm down, a low burning flame that keeps the love alive but doesn't burn as hot and bright, and attachment grows. It's still love, and there's still plenty of attraction both sexual and romantic, but those things wax and wane as life happens, and the life-teammate thing feels pretty amazing as well. So basically, yes, I feel love, but in my 5+ year relationship, sometimes the teammate thing is the purest expression of that love, the powerful and enduring thing that love gives you. \n\n>3, are you sexually attracted to men?\n\nYes. My relationship with my SO began as friends with benefits because I found him sexy even before I knew I was falling in love with him. That doesn't mean I'm sexually attracted to all men or even most, but I am to lots, the ones who are my type. My type doesn't look like Brad Pitt or whoever; lots of girls have quite diverse individual types, some can be attracted to a very wide variety of men and some only develop attraction after getting to know someone. Also, you mentioned \"doing anything a girl asked\". I'm pretty sexually open but I also think it's important to respect others' boundaries and have mine respected. There are lots of things I would do if asked - I mean, look at my username - but not absolutely everything. That doesn't mean I'm not sexually attracted to men.\n\n>I made it a goal to lose virginity before age 14 thinking sex was a big damn deal. Here I am in my middle 20's and much sadder about lonelyness and no love than no sex. :(\n\nWith due respect to people who have sex at 14, that was really unrealistic. I don't know many people who had sex at 14 and I know basically no one who was emotionally ready or mature enough to manage the consequences at that age.\n\n>4, are you attracted to men in other ways than those 2 ways? Things like life companion, being supported with a house and money, raising children with a man that is fit enough to be not a train wreck father, \n\nAbsolutely. The idea of facing the world together is the most beautiful, romantic thing to me.\n\n>being protected from other people and things. Though the last one is some ancient instinct from the cavemen era mostly isn't it.\n\nI still identify with it in that I like the idea of my SO being a safe place for me, and me being a safe place for my SO, even as we challenge each other to grow and be strong.\n\n>5, I do not think it's bad to be attracted in non love and sex ways from all possibilities in question 4. But, am I correct in guessing some women do not have love or sex attraction and only are attracted for question 4 reasons like child and family raising, or money, or boredom or who the hell knows. \n\nYes, that's true. Some people are asexual and aromantic. If you want to know more about that, I would try lurking the AVEN forums. Don't ask questions, just read.\n\n>If yes is there any way to avoid becoming involved with women like that. I am deathly afraid of being used by someone I would fall in love with and they lack any love or attraction for me. Scared enough that if I dont make baby steps like this post and okcupid account, I can be a movie subject like the 40 year old virgin.\n\nYes - you need more life experience. Right now you're really, really naive. You need to get out into the world and learn more about people so that you have more practical knowledge of these things. With time you'll begin to learn more about people. \n\n>6, if you read this far then thank you for dealing with my confusion. Is there any other way or things you can explain that would help with my fears besides these questions? They are just some big questions I don't know any answer to, at least answers I believe deep down, but I am all ears with learning anything you girls can tell me or link me. I will read all comments and any linked material to anything.\n\nRead. Everything. Read Nancy Friday's My Secret Garden. Subscribe to AskWomen and the Sex subreddit and the TwoXChromosomes subreddit. Seriously read Scarleteen. \n\nBut also, you do have to get out into the world. You flat out have to if you ever want to become a person who is capable of healthy relationships. Avoid that and you will be intentionally self-sabotaging. If you don't have a job it's time to get one. You need independence and you're in a situation where you don't seem likely to get it unless you make the real effort you need.\n\n> that I should instead seek professional help from a therapist and those guys. They would waste my time I feel, and I don't want to talk to guys who are paid to give me an answer like \"women are attracted to men obviously because of biology unless they are lesbian\", and what would they tell me that women in here actually interested in helping with this post and my issues could not do. Everything there is to know in life, everyone has to learn somewhere and in their own way remember.\n\nI do hope at some stage you reconsider this. Learning by experience is good, but you've also grown up in what I can only describe as an environment practically designed to arrest development. Some therapists kind of rock at giving you new tools to do the developing on your own."}

If you were willing to listen to what I had to say about the parts that were off-putting to me, as an individual woman who is your potential girlfriend, and work with me so we could both be happy, then okay.  No one starts off as a relationship god/goddess.  It takes work, compromise, and communication. And the realization that not all relationships will work.  So learn what you can from them."}

The whole time I felt this feeling of dread and anxiety...though nothing was actually wrong. There was just this feeling I had that was keeping me from feeling happy or excited, even though it was my birthday! I went out to a few bars and end up heading back home early. Left my friend's in the morning and went home to sleep. My mom called and ask how I was doing and then I heard it. That subtle difference in her voice that meant that she was about to tell me something important. My dog, Betsy, had died the night of my birthday but they didn't want to ruin my night, so they waited until I got home. I truly believe that the feeling of utter sadness I felt that night was related to the death of my dog. I'm still sad when I think about it years later.

This is an open conversational topic about the issue.\n\nThis is an open conversational thread to discuss the recent police murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, and the many others who have been needlessly killed purposefully and negligently at the hands of the police. While some subreddits have gone dark for 24 hours, and some are going dark for 9 minutes, we wanted to find a line that allowed us to allow space for our community to discuss this matter, but also time to reflect on the loss of life and injustice. With that said, we recognize that we are a unique community on Reddit, and we want to give space for the women (and anyone else) of this community to discuss this topic which is why we opted out of a 24 out blackout.

{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskWomen. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Why do you think submissive BDSM is such a popular kink among women?\n\nFirst of all, the claim that women prefer the submissive role in BDSM is supported statistically, and personally anecdotally. Lets start with the sources:\n\n---\n\n*In 71% of the answers the active (restraining) role in bondage was played by heterosexual men, in 11% by heterosexual women and in 12% by homosexual men. 29% of the heterosexual men, 89% of the heterosexual women and 88% of the homosexual men played the passive (restrained) role.*\n\nErnulf, Kurt E.; Innala, Sune M.: Sexual Bondage: A Review and Unobtrusive Investigation. In: Archives of Sexual Behavior, 24, issue 6, 1995, pp. 631-654.\n\n\n*A 1995 study indicates that 89% of heterosexual females who are active in BDSM expressed a preference for a submissive-recipient role in sexual bondage, suggesting also a preference for a dominant male, and 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role.*\n\nErnulf, Kurt E.; Innala, Sune M. (1995). \"Sexual bondage: A review and unobtrusive investigation\". Archives of Sexual Behavior 24 (6): 631–54.\n\n-------\n\nThis supports my anecdotal evidence where three out of four of my serious relationships enjoyed being submissive with bondage. A few of my female friends also have communicated a preference for submissive bondage. I have never encountered a girl that prefers to be dominant, though I know they exist.\n\nFurther more this seems to be a relatively common kink, though I'm finding it difficult to find a source to support or oppose this. I would not consider this kink to be an insignificant outlier in sexual behavior, and thus the internal gender behavior to be non-insignificant as well. Though I could be wrong? For example, there could be a skydiving banana fetish with 10 participants, 80% of which are male, but I wouldn't consider that statistically significant.\n\nSo, my question is why? Why do many girls prefer being submissive, as opposed to dominant? On the surface it seems like the girl is making herself vulnerable, and willfully becoming a sex object. However, I live in a very democratic/liberal area, and all of my female acquaintances are self-described feminists. Fully supporting gender equality, and women's rights. But, to me, this kink seems contradictory to that.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that enjoying consensual BDSM is wrong, evil, or in any way bad. I just seem to have a paradox here that I would like to understand.\n\n(edit: best answer for my perceived paradox is that feminism is not about liberating women so much as letting them be who they want to be. However, this does not explain why the split exists.)\n\nPersonally I neither enjoy nor dislike the activity. If my partner enjoys it, I will happily provide the experience for her because she enjoys it. I still enjoy the sex, but the actual BDSM gives me no extra pleasure.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to register skydivingbananafetish.com\n\nedit: I do not care so much about the male vs female aspect of this split. More, out of a sample of women why do three quarters or more prefer to be submissive in bondage?\n\nedit 2: I get that you can be feminist and submissive without being a hypocrite. I still don't know why women prefer to be submissive over dominant. Interesting hypotheses so far (keeping in mind any true answer is likely a combination):\n\n- Evolutionary behavior holdover from caveman era\n- Result of male dominant society, though this supports the feminist contradiction idea in my opinion\n- Supply of male submissives is low, and results in low female dominants\n- Psychological means of relief/balance after a public life of activity/dominance/control\n- Idiosyncratic, no significant root causes, no pattern.", "assistant": "Those studies are nearly 20 years old.

Then the slut-shaming starts. From authority, from society at large, from ingroup peers and outgroup rivals alike.\n\nBoys, on the other hand, aren't beaten about the head with the same messages. It's... encouraged is the wrong word, but... accepted, maybe(?), that boys have hormones and will act weird because they don't know what to do about it. These boys often grow up having never faced genuine social exclusion or serious punishment for their behaviour and a non-tiny portion grow up still following those patterns fixed in adolescence. Girls aren't afforded the same luxury, so their creepiness is usually (there are creepy adult women too) nipped in the bud.\n\nYoung boys', often inappropriate, sexual behaviour gets an indulgent pat on the head; young girls', often inappropriate, sexual behaviour gets a clip round the earhole."}

Did you listen to your instincts?", "assistant": "My husband took the kids trick or treating and I stayed home to hand out candy. \nAt the end of the night a young kid came to the door and I handed him candy. As he was walking off the porch I noticed a teenage boy standing on the stairs staring at me, and he started walking toward me. \n\nBefore I could think, I loudly said to him, \"Hey hold on\" as I looked back into the house and yelled \"Ok, wait a minute!\" \n\nThe teen stopped, looked at me and then turned and walked away. I quickly locked the door.\n\nThere was noone in the house, I just pretended to answer someone so that the teen didn't think I was alone.\n\nAbout one month later the teen was arrested for raping and murdering someone in our neighborhood. The feeling he gave off in those seconds of meeting can onlying be described as evil."}
{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/AskWomen. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "Question for women - Can you describe an instance where the word \"creepy\" was applied to a guy in a manner that you felt to be unfair?\n\nI'm not asking this with the intention of invalidating the perspectives of individual women, or to make a case against so-called \"creep shaming\". For the record, I think people who behave inappropriately and cause others to feel uncomfortable should be shamed for it. How else will they learn if nobody calls them out on their behaviour? This question is specifically focused on instances where it was applied unfairly.", "assistant": "There are probably times when I've considered someone creepy without them acting inappropriately. It's more about me being creeped out because of my own feelings, less about them being a creep. \n\nFor instance, anytime a man 15+ years older hits on me, he could be the politest person on earth and I would still be creeped out. Or one time a guy I barely knew wrote me a poem....a nice thing to do, but I personally found it creepy."}

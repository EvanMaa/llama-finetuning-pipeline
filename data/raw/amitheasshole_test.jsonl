She is successful and owns her own home. The problem is the Leech. The Leech has been living with her since she bought her house as some part of a thing where the Leech house sat when Emily was deployed and got free rent whenever because my daughter felt sorry for her because she's not right in the head and can't handle stress. I was fine with the leech until it became clear that she was not moving on after Emily retired and was no longer being deployed. She manipulated my daughter into believing that the house was both of there's and that Emily needed the Leech's approval for me to move in. I tried to snap my daughter out of it, but Emily KICKED ME OUT OF HER HOUSE.\n\nWe patched things up a, but neither of them talk to me like before and she doesn't invite me over as much the last couple years.

She would have told me.\n\nI demanded to know what was going on and why was she walking someone else's dog at my daughter's house and demanded she tell the hospital to give me information. She looked right at me and lied. She said it was their dog and Emily did not want me talking to the doctors.

I have two younger brothers, B 16 male and C 13 male (letters do not correspond to their real names) that never pick up or clean up after themselves in general however, the bathroom I have to share with them has been a nightmare. There's always random trash like toilet paper, cardboard, pimple patches, bandaids and other crap left all over the floor sometimes inches away from the bins but never in the actual bin. They've managed to spit toothpaste pretty much everywhere except into the actual sinks and have even left their pee on the floor or on the toilet seat without cleaning it up. B in particular never hangs the shower mat up properly so it's always soaking wet by the time I have to shower later in the evening. I have brought these issues up several times over the last year or so to both my brothers and my parents and lately, my concerns have been met with escalating aggression, gaslighting or just dismissiveness like I'm being silly. For example, when there was always pee left on the floor or on the seat I brought it up to both of my parents and my dad asked \"why can't you just clean it?\" with a straight face. Other times I've brought it up I've been screamed at by both of my brothers and they're both quite a bit bigger than me and I do feel afraid of them both at times because of their aggressive responses to this situation and others.\n\nThese issues have not resolved in the slightest regardless of how I bring it up. It always turns into all of them ganging up against me and acting like I'm crazy and overdramatic. My partner and my friends that I've spoken to about this are all on my side but as someone that has lived with people that have gaslighted me all of my life I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy.

It’s not as if your NTA rating is going to get them to change their behavior.\n\nThe only thing you can do is minimize the impact of their behavior on you. I assume the most obvious option (moving out) isn’t available to you. And I assume that using a different bathroom isn’t an option for you. Although, if you belong to a gym, maybe you can shower there? Or at a friend’s house?\n\nBut if you absolutely have to use the same bathroom as these guys, start doing the following:\n\n- Wipe up pee and toothpaste with the clothes they’ve left on the floor.\n\n- Sweep their clothes and their detritus into a pile in the corner. Every day. Let the pile get as high as it gets. \n\n- Dump their soaking wet bath mat onto the pile of trash and clothes and put down a fresh one for yourself. Hang it up in your room to dry after your shower. \n\nBut really, your best option is to find a way not to share a bathroom with them anymore."}

She’s always been prissy, acts like she’s too good for us, & involves herself in family matters that aren’t her business. For example, she took my brother in when he said he didn’t feel safe at home during college & chewed us out instead of letting him talk to us. She also went to our grandma's funeral, even though she never met her. She can’t take a joke & calls me a creep, because of said jokes.\n\n\n\nShe hates my sister because she thinks my sister looks down on her, & thinks my BIL is a POS, because of something he supposedly did to my brother. She hates my parents kicked her out after a fight with her mom. I agreed because she needed to work things out with her mom instead of seeking help or comfort from my brother. My SIL exaggerates her \"abuse\" to gain sympathy, & her mom says she makes up stories about their family, like how her uncle supposedly abused her as a kid (the implication is there).\n\n\n\nI love my brother, & always thought we were close, but since his fiancé came into the picture, he’s started drifting away from me.

This HAD to be my SIL's decision, because there's no way my brother would leave us out of his wedding without her influence.

I called her controlling & manipulative, & said my brother so much deserved better than her. I said more.\n\n\n\nShe cried, then my brother took the phone, yelled at me to leave her alone & called me an asshole, said he should've cut us off years ago.

They got mad, I went inside, and then I typed this up.\n\nSo AITA for not helping to do the hard work when I’m not wanted in the first place?", "assistant": "ESH.

My (25 F) fiancé and I (22 F) are getting married in October. My future MIL is a plant freak and their entire property looks like something out of a garden magazine. Cobblestone paths, fountains, statues, shaped bushes and some of the most beautiful plants and trees I’ve ever seen. Including willow and cherry blossom trees. \n\nWe’re getting married in the middle of a meadow towards the center of their property and it’s going to be gorgeous. My brother Justin has been dating Sarah for six years and they got engaged a few months ago. I’m not close with Sarah because they live across the state and only come down here for holidays and events. \n\nSarah uses a prosthetic leg and apparently lately it’s been getting to be too much for her so she’s been using a wheelchair. He texted me asking if the property was wheelchair accessible and d I said I didn’t know and would let him know what I found out. There aren’t any stairs but the property has different sections with grass, cobblestone, gravel, and dirt and since I don’t use a wheelchair i don’t know how well they are at getting around in terrain like that. \n\nWe went over to my in-laws to go over the ceremony and reception space and see how difficult it might be for Sarah. I texted my brother to let him know about the terrain. He asked if the reception was in the house and I said no, we were having a tent set up. He asked if we were putting that party tent flooring down and I said no. We looked in to it but it was out of our budget and everything will look nicer in the grass anyways. \n\nHe asked if we would have one set up anyways because the grass would be too hard for Sarah to wheel over and I apologized and told him it was out of our budget by thousands. He told me that if we wouldn’t do that Sarah couldn’t come and we’d be excluding her. I said that it was unfortunate and if that was the case we’d miss her at our wedding. He called me ableist and discriminatory and said that if we wouldn’t accommodate her then he wouldn’t come to our wedding either. \n\nNot even a goddam hour later I got a text from my mom saying that I was being mean to my brother and Sarah and that it wouldn’t be a good look for me if I “decided not to do such a simple thing”. She told me that I could handle renting one of those tent patios since we didn’t pay for a venue and DIYd a lot of our wedding. \n\nI said I was sorry and gave my reasoning again. She told me that if we excluded Sarah they’d pull their contribution to our wedding. I’m not sure how exactly since they paid for our dresses and those were paid for weeks ago. I told her that if her and my brother wanted to foot the but that I’d be more than happy to speak to my MIL about having one put down. She said no. Her and dad are retired and Justin has his own wedding to pay for. \n\nI feel bad for excluding Sarah but I’m not sure what else I can do. AITAH? \n\nEdit to add info. Sarah has used a prosthetic since she’s been with my brother BUT this is the first and only time they’ve mentioned her being in a wheelchair. We sent out save the dates with my MILs address as the venue about 8 months ago and 2 months ago sent out formal invitations with more information regarding her property (parking, outdoors, length of walk to ceremony etc) and I hadn’t heard anything from my brother or Sarah besides a returned rsvp for yes. \n\nEdit 2. The quotes we were given for something that we were sure wouldn’t harm my MILS lawn was about $6,000 to $9,000 to rent for the evening. Our budget was $15,000 and we are already at the top end of it. \n\nEdit 3. The reason I didn’t suggest or look into a different kind of chair or scooter was because I just figured that that was something Sarah and Justin would have looked into themselves since they were the ones needing it. I figured since they jumped right to a $9,000 solution at my pocket that the other options wouldn’t work for them and they were bringing up the last available option. Also my fiancés grandma is wheelchair bound as well but has been to my MILs house plenty of times and it hasn’t come up as an issue. \nAnd for everyone upset about us getting married in grass and that people will struggle with their heels, I said in my post that in our invitations we had information about my MILs property. I’m sure people will dress accordingly considering they’re aware of the venue. Not sure why people are mad about that.", "assistant": "NTA\n\nAs one who pushed his (late) wheelchair-bound wife for many hundreds of miles, I think I can present a valid opinion.  A normal wheelchair, not a \"transport\" chair with all small wheels, can be pushed on grassy surfaces with some effort if, of course, the terrain isn't super muddy and soft.  And a gravel path shouldn't be that big a deal either.  If we're not talking huge distances on the grass, this shouldn't be more than an inconvenience."}

A couple of weeks ago I left due to an argument and didn't come back until yesterday. When I came back she called me into her room to talk and had her friend on the phone. This particular friend is supposed to be my godfather even though I've never met him\n\nWhen I came into the room the friend said that he was glad that I was home and that I needed to stop lashing out and not leave again. I told him that leaving for a little while was what was best for my mental health. He and my mother both said \"No it's not\" and I replied with \"Maybe it's not to you but it was to me and you can't tell me what is and what isn't good for my mental health\". They said that my siblings missed me and hate it when I leave. I said that that's what happens when you grow up around other children. Eventually they grow up and leave and live their own lives\n\nThey changed the subject and started talking about my siblings (19M 16M and 13F) saying that I needed to do more to help my mother with them and make sure that they do what they're supposed to do (like chores, schoolwork, etc.). I told her no. I've been basically raising my siblings my whole life and I wasn't going to play replacement parent to them anymore. And plus she's asked me to help before and when I tried she wouldn't listen and all she did was get angry at me and say \"You're not the mother. I am\". Besides they're all old enough to know what their supposed to do\n\nMy mother said that she's tired and needs a break and can't work and take care of them at the same time and really needs my help. I told her that I've been helping her without even a thank you and now I'm done and need to start figuring out and living my own life. Her and her friend called me selfish and said that I only look at it that way because of my mindset and that I need to change my mindset and help the family more\n\nI stood my ground and said that I just wanted to focus on myself from now on and that my siblings are old enough to know what they're supposed to do and if they don't do it then she needs to discipline them. Her friend asked me what I think the proper discipline should be and I said that's up to my mother. He said that's too much work for her to do and asked why she should have to worry about things like that after getting off of work and said that I should do it \n\nI stood my ground and said \"No. You're asking me to play mommy to them which I'm not going to do. I'm the big sister not the mother\". They called me a selfish asshole for not wanting to be a part of the family and helping. So AITAH?\n\nEdit: A few people are asking where our father is. We all have different dad's. I never knew mine. My mother and 19Ms father broke up when I was 6 and I never saw him again after that. A year later my mother met and married 16M and 13Fs father and he died about 3 years ago. But even when he was alive I still did everything while they stayed in their room doing whatever\n\nEdit 2: To answer a few questions. Yes I work. I get up before dawn almost every morning and take 3 buses to work and 3 buses back when I get off. I don't pay rent but if she needs financial help then I give it to her. As far as other housework like cooking and cleaning etc. since those are required for taking care of my siblings as well as myself then yes I've been doing those things since I was in elementary school", "assistant": "NTA why is this random guy even involved?

The mother mentioned that her daughters name was \"Grain\" so I assumed for a while that she was another mother who wanted something \"special\" to call her child. I remarked that it was a unique name and that I'd never met anyone called Grain before.\nShe told me that she's named after her great-grandmother and that it's an Irish name. At this point, the alarm bells are ringing in my head because I've realised that the kid is called Gráinne (generally pronounced as Gro-nyuh, or there abouts.) \nI tried to be very tactful, and I was like, \"Irish has such an interesting alphabet. How is her name spelled? Irish names can be tricky.\" \nThe kid is called Gráinne. Not Grain. \nMy partner, who has studied Ireland's political history as part of their dissertation and also the Irish diaspora and it's culture around their university city,  is stuck somewhere between stifling a laugh and dying of embarrassment on her behalf so I come up with, what I thought was a very positive reply.\nI said \"an old-school name and a more modern pronunciation. I think that's a great way to pick names.\" I would like to point out that I do not like the name Grain for a child, nor do I like the way the pronunciation was butchered, but I was trying to be tactful and positive. She asked what I meant, and I said \"well in Ireland, they typically pronounce it like \"gro-nyuh\".\"\nHer face went red and said that I shouldn't have said that the pronunciation was wrong in front of the kid because now she's going to grow up knowing that her name is wrong and feel bad about it. I apologised for causing offence and restated that it's a lovely name in both ways and a fantastic nod to her heritage. I said that I'm sure her great-grandmother would be thrilled to be honoured by her name being used. I was throwing out just about every positive reinforcement that I could think of, but, to be frank, she was pissed off. \nShe told me that I \"ruined her daughter's self-esteem\" and that her \"life [was] ruined\" by me saying that \"her existence is wrong.\" I didn't say that, by the way. I said that her name was pronounced atypically. Gráinne, for context, was around 2 years old and completely unbothered by the conversation until her mother got angry at me. She was just looking at the pictures on my jacket. The conversation was maybe five minutes long, but I managed to ruin this kid's life. \nHindsight says I should have kept my mouth shut and waited for somebody else in this city to say something. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: spelling and syntax\nEdit 2: Some people have assumed that we're in the USA, we're in the UK, in a city with lots of Irish people, an Irish centre, and a great Irish folk scene.", "assistant": "NTA.

The options for sleeping are either in the guest bedroom directly under the heater vent, or in the living room under the ceiling fan, which will be shut off at 5am sharp when stepdad gets up, because he thinks he'll freeze to death if there's a breeze in his balmy 80 degree house\n\nSo I got woke up after very little sleep by an old man kicking into the chair I'm sleeping on as he's turning off the fan, and I start to sweat bullets within 5 minutes.

Kiara just turned 12 a few months ago and said she wanted to go to Renfair this year.

I was already living in the apartment and we found each other after my previous roommate moved out. The common areas of the apartment were fully furnished when she moved in. \n\nIn the living room there was a white couch that a family member had given to me. I took it to furnish this apartment even though I dislike white furniture. It also extends into a bed for guests. Because it is white, I avoided using it knowing I would get it dirty. When I am pet sitting dogs at the apartment I cover it with a sheet to prevent dirt and fur from getting on it and inspect it afterwards to make sure no damage was done.\n\nI began noticing stains popping up on the couch and the bed extension. The couch was deep cleaned by my previous roommate before she left. She started letting her friend stay over on the couch and that is when most of the stains started appearing. She wouldn't put any sheets on the couch when she had guests over sleeping on it even tho they were accessible to her in the couch storage under the cushions. \n\nShe was never the cleanest or most careful person. She would spill stuff and not clean it up. She broke my ice cube tray, my mason jar, and damaged my dining table. She would use dirty dishes and put them with the clean ones in the cupboard. She had a lot of stuff that cluttered the common areas of the apartment. \n\nI never asked her to replace or pay for anything she has damaged with the exception of the couch. I asked her if she would be willing to split the cost of professionally cleaning the couch with me before I moved out since I had reason to believe some of the stains may have been caused by her. She refused and said she felt she had no obligation to pay because I let her use my couch and the stains were normal wear and tear. In my opinion, multiple stains over the span of a few months is not wear and tear, it is a lack of respect and cleanliness when using other people's things. If you damage someone else's property even if given permission to use it, I believe you're partially responsible for fixing it. The cost was $90 after the split (I'm not sure if this is a bad, normal, or high price).\n\nI know now I should have taken pictures of the couch before she moved in because she also tried to push blame onto me saying I made the stains. Knowing how and how often I use the couch, they do not align with the stains that began to appear. Of course, I can't prove that they weren't me which is why I offered to split the cost 50-50.  \n\nThere are many other things I could say that might strengthen my case of why I think she should help me pay for it and why I think she refused, but that would be an even longer story.

For background, I’m bisexual and have been out for about 4 years now. Addison is also on the queer spectrum. Hazel is straight.\n\nYesterday in class, we were tossing light hearted insults back and forth, then mostly calling me old and me mostly calling them short. Hazel called me a dinosaur and I said “Oh I’m sorry, I can’t hear you from all the way down there,” with a small laugh. Hazel immediately shot back, “Well at least I’m not a fucking f*ggot.” With zero hesitation. I was gobsmacked of course, but simply stopped talking to her.

Please don’t call me that again.” I remember every word because I rehearsed it in my head all class. She said “Oh, well it’s okay.

She is 19 and her first year of college was commuting because of her anxiety. She decided to go to college in person this year and is staying in the dorms. The problem is her food card isn't working.  It’s something that can easily be fixed by contacting the college dining services, but she refuses to go talk to them.

But, be very clear with her, that you will not enable her to ignore this problem because there will come a day in which she will not have you to solve things like this for her and make sure she knows that being able to do things like this should be a part of her treatment plan/ a goal she is actively working towards. It's okay to be understanding of the fact that her anxiety is so bad she cannot do this and to recognize that limitation, but that then also means she is responsible for working to get to a place where she can overcome this with your help as a parent.\n\nIf she cannot pick and successfully execute options 1 or 2 then she isn't ready to be living on her own and needs to admit that. So if she digs in her heels and/or refuses to address the problem or if your spouse fixes it for her, then don't keep paying for dorms.\n\nShe's basically told you through her behavior that she isn't capable of resolving very basic problems which means that she can't be trusted to look out for herself in the dorms. If a dorm mate overdosed, attempted or completed suicide, had a mental health crisis, had serious alcohol poisoning, or experienced a sexual assault (all statistically possible things in a college dorm) would she be able to handle talking to campus security, an RA, EMTs, school administrators, or even law enforcement? Or is she a walking, talking, liability for herself and anyone who lives with her? What happens if there is a fire or flood in her dorm and she needs to arrange other temporary housing through school administrators at a time when you cannot pick up the phone?\n\nObviously there are future implications to this level of anxiety as she gets older, but you also need to look at how safe she is right now in the present moment. Her anxiety is so bad that starvation seems like the better option to going in and talking to dining services. Which begs the question, what else would she chose over having to contact authorities? Would she not contact them and instead ignore it if there is an obvious prowler in the dorm or even just a broken window anyone could get in? She's telling you she's not safe to be on her own yet, and you'd be an asshole if you ignored that.\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing all your comments that you can't force her to go to therapy. You're right, you can't. But you can tell her, adult to adult, about the potential repercussions of her refusal to address this problem and work through this and then, if she fails to listen let her face some of those consequences in a protected way. You don't have to pay for her meal card, her dorm, etc. Nor should you if they aren't being put to good use (hint: she's likely not talking to professors in the way she should be as a sophomore in college trying to network). I know it feels harsh, but not preparing her is a far greater risk than just helping her muddle through while not addressing this or trying to force her to suddenly address it on her own in a way she isn't capable of.\n\nI had a friend who sounds a lot like her in college. My friend's parent lived several miles from our college and did a lot for her (too much). Until that parent had a heart attack. We helped her navigate the funeral and basics that came after, for awhile, but there were some things she basically could not do on her own that needed to be done. She dropped out of college (it was all too overwhelming), attempted to get to a new location for a job driving the car she inherited, ended up stranded in a small town when she couldn't figure out how to put gas in that car due to some of the same kind of challenges that your daughter seems to be having, found someone to \"help\" and got arrested soon after because that helper had drugs on them, etc. She spent a night in jail before that got sorted by a guy we knew with a crush on her who bailed her out. Married him soon after because he promised her she could be a stay at home mother and wouldn't have to navigate all those scary adult things on her own, got pregnant, he became emotionally abusive, etc. In other words, it spiraled fast (within two years of losing her parent she completely dependent on this guy to do basics like call their landlord and pay taxes while her peers from college were starting grad school).  I'm sharing that to make it clear that you aren't doing her any favors. My former friend's parent probably thought it wasn't a huge deal that their child never knew how to put gas in a car and didn't think they could force her into therapy to work on that anxiety either. But it ended up being a huge one (among many other things she would avoid doing because of anxiety/ get her parent to help her work around). I remember freshman year she'd go home once a week and get her parent to put gas in the car. If they'd, just once, helped her recognize the problem with not being able to do it herself, I really do think she'd be in much better shape."}

I actually have a UK passport since my dad is British, but my friend had to get a UK visa. We were supposed to take two flights, one that would arrive in France, and a connecting flight that would fly to the UK.\n\nHowever, the second flight ended up being cancelled. The next available flight wasn’t until 2 pm the next day, so we would have to wait around 17 hours. The passengers were allowed to stay in nearby hotels for free. However, this didn’t apply to people like my friend, who wasn’t legally allowed to leave the airport because she didn’t have a visa for Europe.\n\nInstead, she had to stay within a specific area of the airport that had these bright ceiling lights that would stay on 24/7. There was construction nearby, so there was this extremely loud drilling noise every so often. All the available seats were taken by other passengers, so my friend had to sleep on the floor. Plus, earlier that day, water got spilled on our phone chargers, and her phone was only on 40%.\n\nI had the option to stay with her, but I chose to go to the hotel instead. She was furious with me, accusing me of being a fake friend. She told me she was scared of being alone in a creepy unknown place and wanted me there to comfort her, and I assured her that I’ll be back by the morning.

You are selfish, it’s one night. She told you she didn’t feel safe, if anything happened and her phone died there would have been no way for her to contact anyone. At least you would have had eachother but she had to stay at a bright airport while you slept comfortably because you ‘didn’t see why you both had to suffer’.

After the ceremony ended I couldn't find my parents anywhere. I was looking around for them and then I decided to check my phone. My mom sent me a text a while ago letting me know that my sister went into labor and her and my dad were at the hospital. This upset me because I thought my parents were there but realizing that they weren't just made me sad. I saw everyone else with their family taking pictures and stuff and I was just standing there awkwardly not knowing what to do. My mom told me that they would be back asap to come and get me.\n\n They did not. I waited for a good 20 minutes watching everyone else leave. I decided to just walk home because I got tired of waiting. I walked 3 miles before my parents drove by and made a u turn to come and pick me up. They were mad when they saw me walking. They told me that It was disrespectful of me to for leave with out telling them and accusing me of putting myself in danger. \n\nI told them that It wasn't alot of people left at the ceremony and I didn't want to wait anymore. I also told them that they knew it was important for them to be there and they completely bailed on me.  They told me that they were sorry and kept trying to justify why they left. I told them that it doesn't make sense for them to leave when my sisters husband were there with her and if they really wanted to abandon me they could have at least had one of them stay with me but they left me with no one to watch me and ruined what was supposed to be a good day for me. \n\nMy sister didn't even give birth that day she gave birth like 18 hours later which pissed me off more. The problem is my parents are upset with me because they wanted to take another picture of me with my cap and gown on but I refused. The one they took of me in the car I wasn't smiling and my parents wanted a redo because of it. \n\nI told them no. I said that if they already had a picture of me and that it's all they are gonna get. I told them that there are pictures of me on my school's facebook page and they can screen shot it from there or can leave it alone. If they choose to attend my college graduation they can maybe see me in another cap and gown.

My brother Josh (29M) recently started dating Lindsey (27F), and while she’s been polite at family events, Lily feels Lindsey has made some passive-aggressive comments. \n\nFor example, at a recent BBQ, Lindsey said it was “selfish” that Lily and I weren’t planning to have kids anytime soon. Lily felt uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything at the time. Another incident happened at a family dinner when Lindsey remarked, “I’m surprised you two are so happy without kids. You must be really good at being selfish.” Lily was hurt by that comment, and it made her feel like Lindsey was judging our life choices. Most recently, at a birthday party, Lindsey made a comment about Lily’s career, saying, “It’s cute that you’re working part-time with no kids while Josh and I are really focusing on our careers.” Lily was annoyed, but didn’t say anything because she didn’t want to start drama. \n\nThanksgiving is at our house this year, and when Josh asked if he could bring Lindsey, I told him I’d prefer if she didn’t come.

However - even at the pay rate of this position, it would cover the monthly cash burn delta by about 3x and take immeasurable pressure off of me and our finances. \n\nI understand not wanting to take a step back, but in my mind even one or two steps back is better than no job at all.

Our dad is pacific islander, and our mom is just white. My sister (14) and I (17) were both born in the US. Our parents divorced when I was six I think. However I continued to live my dad until I was 11, whereas my sister stayed with my mom. I live with my mom now because my dad wanted to move back to the islands, but I didn't want to leave my friends. However I know much of my family who still do live on the islands, and keep in touch with my 'roots' I guess. This is mostly thanks to my dad. My sister doesn't. Okay so onto the story.\n\nAbout four months ago my sister was diagnosed with Sarcoma which is like a kind of bone/tissue cancer. She's had to go through a lot of procedures and spend a lot of time at the hospital, and I've spent a lot of it with her and helping her, and while I don't mind helping her, when she did get diagnosed my Mom expected me to drop literally everything to be there to help her. Meaning if she's at the hospital, I'm at the hospital. If she's undergoing a surgery or 'stressful procedure' I have to stop everything I'm doing (including school) and sit in the waiting room as support.\n\nBut all that I could handle and it was annoying but whatever. However recently the doctors finally decided they wanted to do Chemo, and my sisters hair has begun to fall out. She shaved it, but is extremely upset about it, because she really loved her hair. The other day my mom suggested that I shave my own hair so a wig can be made out of it for her. For reference my hair goes down to below my butt. However the thing is you're only supposed to cut your hair when a family member dies, and it's a tradition my entire family (dad's side) upholds. And to be frank, I like my hair and have no desire to shave it, as I have been growing it out since I was a kid.\n\nI explained this to both my sister and my mom, but both are instant that I should do it, and that a tradition like that is meaningless, especially since my sister might die anyways. I told them no. They've both asked several times more, and my sister even begging. I once again reiterated why I wouldn't, and that asking me too was insulting.\n\nNow my sister is upset and saying that I obviously don't actually care that she's struggling and aren't being understanding. However I've bent over backwards for her, so the fact she's going so far hurts. But she's also never asked me of anything like this before and is really upset, so I just don't know, AITA??", "assistant": "NTA\n\n\nYour mom can use her own hair if she wants to so bad."}

They broke the TV throwing a baseball in the house and my step-dad lost his mind and demanded I pay him back for it but I told him I was sick of being blamed for his awful kids and he could shove it.

She said it’s insensitive when we know that she’s infertile.

I kind of want to uninvite her from my baby shower next week because I’m scared she’ll ruin the vibe. WIBTA if I did that. I feel bad for her, but she can’t keep bringing negativity to all of our celebrations.

My partner says some of her underwear can't go in the dryer because it gets worn out. When I've dried our laundry, there have been times that I've forgotten to take her underwear out because I'm simply not used to having to consider that. When that happens, she gets angry/pouts and tells me to try harder, saying that my forgetfulness is just the result of not trying hard enough. As a result, I've said that if it's that important that she'll get angry at me or excessively guilt trip me about it, she can put the laundry in the dryer and I'll put it in the washer.\n\nJust now, we had an argument where I clarified that if she's willing to not get angry at me for forgetting to take her underwear out sometimes, I'm willing to do all the laundry. She didn't accept that, and doubled down on that I should simply try harder.\n\nWho is the asshole?\n\nEDIT: Well I feel validated in posting this seeing in how varied the responses are. I've come to the conclusion that we should probably just get a lingerie bag or do separate laundry. Sticky notes are an okay idea, but they've failed for a previous issue we had as they go unconsciously ignored as I'm going about my day thinking about other things. As for all the people responding with some version of \"weaponized incompetence,\" all I can say is that yes, I have been incompetent in the past, I would most likely be occasionally (though increasingly less frequently) incompetent in the future, and she is not willing to have that occasional result. I'm baffled by those who think competence in something like this is an on-off switch.

So we arranged a lunch for them to get together. It was an earlier lunch so they could make it in time for the other things they had planned with the maternal side. The thing they were not expecting was their dad and his wife, who they are no contact with, to be there. Their grandparents surprised them with this after we all got there and it was awkward as hell. It was also my 3rd time meeting their dad.\n\nTheir dad's wife kept watching them and trying to get their attention. They ignored her. Then she outright asked where her Happy Mother's Day wishes were which they ignored. She asked about gifts and tried to claim the gifts all three brought for their grandmother. BIL told her nothing was for her and why would she ever think they'd get her anything. GFIL tried to calm things down by talking over everyone but it didn't work because their dad's wife just got louder. She started listing off all the gifts she'd received from them when they were kids and living with her and her husband (FIL). SIL told her they weren't ever actually from them and that their dad had bought them and added their names but it was nothing to do with them. Their dad's wife then turned on SIL and blamed her saying she manipulated the boys to feel the same as she did and it was wrong because they were all young enough when their \"birth mother\" died for them to embrace and benefit from a new mother. My husband laughed at that and said SIL was the youngest and only 5 when their mom died and their dad went out to replace her ASAP because he was pathetic and didn't want to raise his own kids. He said she clearly thought SIL was a very very manipulative and intelligent 5 year old to believe that and pointed out she was very quick to always blame SIL for things. BIL added they were never going to accept some random person who came in months after their mom died and attempted to assert her dominance over them as a \"mother\". He said he didn't care if their dad was unfair to her as well because she was downright evil to try and replace their mom. It got so heated that I suggested to my husband that we just move on.\n\nLater that night my husband's grandparents called me to apologize and said they had no idea how things went so wrong. This is where I might be TA because I told them they shouldn't have surprised their grandkids by inviting FIL and his wife like that if they wanted the lunch to go better. I told his grandparents that they know my husband and his siblings are no contact and no love for their dad or his wife and they know they used to fight all the time.

For some background that may mportant to the story, I am a 26 year old man, and I live alone. When I was 5 years old, I was diagnosed with ‘high functioning’ autism. \n\nBecause of my autism, I have a special interest in the children’s show PAW Patrol. It is a huge aspect of my life and personality, and I find myself often collecting merchandise from the show. One of my spare bedrooms is decorated completely PAW patrol based, and the walls are covered in shelves where I display my figures/plushies.\n\nOnto the story now, my older sister (29f) asked to stay with me for a week or two with her two kids (11 and 9 m) because I have an empty room, and her and her husband had been having really bad arguments nonstop and she needed to take a break and make sure it wouldn’t affect her children’s emotional health.\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, they came to my place and I settled them into the guest room (different from the room I keep my merchandise.) and had to go to work at about 7:00 A.M. I told my sister to just relax for a while and to make herself at home, with my only stipulations being she and her boys keep away from my merchandise room and my bedroom.\n\nI came home from work later on to the children asleep on my couch and my sister having a shower. Once I had went into my merchandise room to check up on it, it was a mess. Figures were on the ground, and lots of my stuffed animals were moved from where they go on their shelves. Nothing was damaged aside from a PAW Patrol toothbrush that I kept sealed and on display, it was opened and on the floor.\n\nI got really upset at my sister and sort of wanted to cry, (Autism affects my emotional regulation, especially when a situation is related to my special interest.) and I started to ask my sister to replace the toothbrush since her children went in the room I asked them all not to go in. I didn’t raise my voice, but I was very upset and angry.\n\nShe refused and told me I’m a d**ck for asking her to replace something I left out in the open, and we just kept arguing. Eventually, I was close to having a meltdown because my PAW Patrol items are really important to me, and I felt ignored and belittled. I asked her and her children to leave my house, and offered to get her a hotel room for a while because I was struggling to calm down. I may be an AH for acting this way.

That's very reasonable!\n\nShe let her kids go in the room and play with your stuff without permission, and they opened a packaged toothbrush for some strange reason (I mean, it's not even opening a toy, it's a toothbrush, why would they touch that?). Then she blamed you for leaving it \"out in the open\" - in the room they weren't supposed to be in.\n\nNow she thinks you should keep letting her stay there where they will definitely trash your stuff on purpose now.\n\n(Autism and special interest are red herrings here. They make this feel more important and emotional to you. But without that, if you were allistic and you had whatever in that room, she would still be totally in the wrong.)"}

My brother was running his mouth about my last girl, let’s call her Ivy.

I moved back up to my home state in September of 2023, mostly to get away from my toxic family and for better opportunities. Also to add why this is even an issue in the first place, My brother Jay(25M) and I are the \"black sheep\" of the family, mostly due to the fact we were born and mostly raised outside of marriage. The teasing and neglect only grew worse after our mother(44F) married Jerkfish(54M) and had our half siblings; (20F), (17M), (16M), and (11M).\n\nNow, here's the dilemma. My half-sister who we will call Jojo(20F) is getting married to Rhitt(22M) in July. My mom and grandma asked that I make them a wedding cake, which I would've happily agreed to if I was invited to the wedding. The thing is, they wanted me to make a cake fit for 200 people, get a hotel near them (They hate that I'm not a Christian, so they think I'll bring evil into their house), work for 3 days, and get a flight there and back. I'd have to pay for all of it, they think it'd be a nice gift to my sister. I just laughed and sent them my price sheet, they. flipped. out. I was bombarded with texts from them about how selfish I am, how I am truly vile, how I am toxic for expecting my family to pay for my cake when they could just go to Walmart to get one, etc..\n\nJojo even messaged me on discord a week after I had sent the price sheet and asked why I would charge her when I made my best friend a free wedding cake. I simply told her to f off as not only was I invited to her wedding, but I was the MOH and in a way it was a \"returning the favor\" for being a genuinely good friend and helping me out when I was going through a lot.\n\nJay and his wife had said I'm not wrong for it and they'd do the same thing, and my boyfriend is on my side. However, a few people in my life are saying I should've just said a simple no instead of sending the sheet and that my response to my sister was harsh. So, I need an outside perspective, hopefully other bakers on here too.\n\nAITA?\n\n  \nUpdate #1: I found out the exact reason for my brother's family and I not getting invited. Three months after my sister and her soon-to-be husband got engaged, my grandmother requested my sister not invite \"the sinners\". It was more along the lines of: \"If you don't invite your siblings you'll get a hefty portion of my will.\". Don't really know what the proper term for that is, but I digress.  So, my sister is catering to the needs of my racist grandmother over her own sisters. I also found out another reason(out of the many) why my brother and I where black sheep in the family. So, you see. my mother is whiter than paper. My brother and i's biological father is Lakota/Sioux native American.  We were told he just left us \"because that's how the savages act.\" when in reality, our dad died from a terminal raspatory illness that he had since he was a toddler. Some cyst type of deal? Not too sure. The hatred from them only grew further when my brother married a black woman and had my 3 nieces together. (Fourth on the way). I told jojo how hurt I was by picking money over family but I kinda expected it. She tried to offer me $50 to make the cake she wanted and I just declined. i shared this post with my brother and he is rolling while reading the comments. Also, to the people who dm'ed me to tell me that they hope i go out of business (My boss says hi btw) and that I deserved getting abused as child because I'm a snot now...

Before I officially booked the Air B&B that we would all be splitting the price on, I sent each of them the listing, showing how many bedrooms, what accommodations, etc. I made sure to double check with my brother as the house is only 2 bedrooms. One room has 2 full size beds, the other a king bed. I asked if he would mind sharing a room with me as 3 bedrooms in this area were harder to find. He said it was fine because we’d each have our own bed and asked me to book it. Once our parents signed off on it, I booked it.\n\nWhen we arrive, before we even have our first night’s sleep, my brother declares he thinks he and I should alternate sleeping on the pull out couch in the living room. I say I’m not going to do that. If he doesn’t want to sleep in the room designated for us, that’s fine. But I’m not sleeping on a pull out on vacation when there’s 2 beds.

He basically started explaining my work to me, but in a completely wrong way and missed all of my points. I asked him if he was sure that that was what the author meant and he said that he was because it was \"pretty simple actually\".

He reacted very badly and got angry, and he told me that I had manipulated him to humiliate him. He yelled at me for not saying it was my work at the beginning. I simply replied that he had embarrassed himself and left. \n\nI woke up this morning to texts from my friends saying I was wrong for causing drama and tension and that I could've been nicer to their friend. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong there. I mean yes, I could've told him right away, but is it that big of a deal that I didn't? I'm not exactly sure. AITA? \n\nEdit: I forgot to make this clear and maybe it's a bit of a misunderstanding, but both conversations happened only between the two of us. We were the only ones talking about our work and our friends also weren't really there when I told him that I was the author. So it's not like I publicly humiliated him. The only thing \"embarrassing\" for him here is that a woman seemed smarter than him, and I think that's what ge had an issue with.\n\nEdit 2: I've seen some comments claiming that this post was fake because \"that just doesn't happen\", \"i've seen many other stories where the same thing happens\", \"that's not realistic\". I'm not trying to justify anything because I don't really care, but I just find it funny to see lots of comments from women sharing similar stories and then lots of comments from men saying it doesn't happen.", "assistant": "NTA\n\nThis is hilarious."}

I am never so lucky to be there when that happens, the shops are always very picked over with just Old Navy or Target clothes whenever I can go, so I was happy I might find something. \n\nI started browsing normally and was finding some good stuff for once, then I saw a group of 3 women come in. One had a little computer for scanning books, the other two had ipads or something, I assume to check resale prices? Either way they were clearly resellers and started grabbing stuff after checking labels. \n\nI felt a sense of dread because I wouldn’t be fast enough to check, so I just swooped everything off the rack and into my cart in my size. \n\nWhen the two got to me they started staring. I said “What?” and one was like “We’d like to be able to see what’s on the rack too.”\n\nI said that they could as soon as I was done. \n\nShe scoffed at me and said “That’s rude, we'd like a chance to shop these clothes too.”\n\nI just ignored her and started looking at things one by one, taking my time, then putting them right back on the rack. The women were getting mad and snatching things basically out of my hand. I held up a nice top and one of them tried grabbing it OUT of my hand and I said “Excuse you” and turned my back to her. They got all pissy and one stomped away to get a worker.\n\nThe worker came over and asked what was going on. I said I was looking at the items from the rack, same as anyone else. They said I was “hoarding everything” so they couldn’t get a chance to look. The worker said that I wasn’t doing anything wrong, and then said to me “Thank you for putting everything back when you’re done.”\n\nI finished what I was doing with the women breathing down my neck and took my clothes to go try on. One of them kept following me and asked me what the fuck my problem was, why I was being such a bitch, etc. I said “Sorry that you’re having a bad day, but it’s really not my problem.”\n\nAITA?

Immediately I’m like “why am I just hearing this now and right before your about to tell your whole team about my moms bf’s willy?” She told me that she just forgot about it. (I don’t know exactly how something like that would be so easy to forget??)\n\nThe reason I’m so conflicted is because it’s supposed to be an embarrassing story about yourself not about my mom? Like I’m always going to team games cheering my gf on, hanging with her teammates, and sometimes my mom will come watch a game. Plus my little sister used to play on the team where she was bullied/excluded so the team knows exactly who this story’s about. I feel like it embarrasses my family more than anything \n\nAITA for not wanting her to share that info? \nI think I would be more open to the idea of my gf sharing the story if she had told me closer to the time of the event. When I told her those exact thoughts she said “I didn’t think I needed to tell you” and “should I not tell you things like this in the future?” Idk I feel weird about the whole thing and I feel like I ruined her fun moment.", "assistant": "NTA\n\nIt's not funny to share private conversations/moments with people about someone else. You're right. This is supposed to be about HER, not your mom and her bf."}

She’d been playing dirty by trying to frame him as an abusive cheater, even though all the actions she’d been accusing him of are things she had been doing to him.\n\nHe ended up having to hire a lawyer so he’d have a chance at being able to fight against her. He’s not good when it comes to technology, so when the lawyer asked for an email to contact him through he ended up giving mine. He has one, but he never uses it and thought that just giving the lawyer my email would be the easier solution because when I say “he’s not good with technology” I mean he’s so bad that I’ve watched him struggle to figure out how to even hang up the phone when someone calls him.\n\nThe lawyer sends an invoice at the beginning of each month to let him know how much he was charged from the previous month. I have memory issues and he knows this. There’s been multiple incidents where someone has had conversations with me only for me to completely forget that interaction even happened the moment it was over.\n\nHe asked me two days ago if the lawyer had sent him an invoice for July, and after checking my email I found that it had been sent on the 9th of this month. He looked at it and after seeing he owed the lawyer money, got upset at me for not telling him as soon as I saw it. When the lawyer sent it, even though my memory can be absolute shit at times I can remember that we had been busy the entire day and even though I have email notifications on I hadn’t seen it because of that. I remember because while we were running errands I’d bought myself a box of donuts from my favorite donut shop and he bought some wood, that he used fix a part of the living room floor the next day.\n\nI asked two of my friends what they thought of the situation and they’re thinking he probably should have been checking in on if the lawyer sent me something every week instead of what seems like every other month, and I kind of want to agree but I also want to get an outsider’s perspective on this.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Apparently it’s hard for people to believe my memory issues and that I genuinely didn’t think to give the lawyer my dad’s email or have everything automatically forwarded to his email.\n\nAs far as my memory issues go, I have good and bad days. The example of me forgetting conversations right after they end are some of my bad days. I don’t have any official diagnosis to explain it, but my friends and I are pretty sure I have undiagnosed POTS and DID. A lot of the physical issues I have line up with POTS along with the days where I feel like my brain is surrounded by a thick cloud of fog, and with the amount of trauma I have from my mom I’d be genuinely surprised if I don’t have DID or something close to it. That’s not even mentioning how I’d be surprised if my mom doing drugs and was smoking cigarettes while pregnant with me hadn’t had some long term effects on me. I don’t know the full extent, but I know it was bad enough that I’d been going through withdrawal as a newborn.\n\nWith me not mentioning my age, I saw at least one comment accusing me of not mentioning it because “You’re probably old enough that you should know better” and I’m pretty sure that just depends on how you look at it. If you’re going off the standards of a “normal” person, aka someone that doesn’t have mental disabilities and was raised normally instead of someone that has mental disabilities and was raised by a mom who had tried isolating me from the world so I’d always be dependent on her with no way to escape, then yeah I guess 23 could be considered “old enough”.\n\nI don’t know anywhere near enough of what’s considered “common sense” for someone my age because of her.

It had been sitting for a few months but I spent the past few weeks fixing all the little issues, making it look and run great. During this time it had an issue of overheating when pushed to the max speed which was new, but would do fine at regular cruising speed. I replaced all the cooling components in the motor and the issue went away. I took it out three times with no issues and decided I would be good to put it up for sale. Sold it four days ago to a super nice younger guy who was excited for his first full sized boat. He bought it for $5,500 and was super happy about it, said he thought it all looked great. He took it out two times that I’m aware of with no issues whatsoever. But today he sent me a video of the overheat alarm going off and said it happened when he was halfway back from the sandbar this afternoon. I did some simple troubleshooting and didn’t hear anything back from him until he messaged me asking about getting money back if it has issues. I told him I would not do that because to my knowledge there were no problems when he bought it and he was able to try it out himself with no problems. I feel super bad if there are problems with it but I did my absolute best to avoid this situation. The boat is thirty years old and in great condition for its age, but something had to stop working eventually I suppose.

At the time of sale I was under the impression I had fully fixed the issue and tested to make sure this was true. It would seem either I didn’t truly fix the issue or something else has happened.

But my oldest brother has two daughters. Oldest is now 7, younger just turned 5. I love both of them a lot, but I'm not blind. As someone who grew up with siblings, it's very clear that oldest daughter (ON) is golden child. She gets whatever she wants, no matter how expensive, and is always showered with praise for her pageants and singing. My younger niece (YN) is very shy, but she is still very sweet and enjoys things like reading and animals. Recently, my YN has been feeling bad about herself. I asked why, and she told me it was because she didn't like her hair color. She's got auburn curls. She was sad because everyone always said how pretty ON's hair was, which was a very light blonde and straight. It got so bad that she'd apparently tried to cut it off, which her mom had just laughed off as childhood mishap. \n\nWhen I was over at brother's house, I noticed that the two were playing with dolls. ON had a very nice Barbie doll, while YN had what looked like a short, cheap Walmart knockoff. I asked why, and mom said it was because she couldn't find a doll with red hair. This made me upset, because 1. The doll's hair is bright red, which is not her hair color, and 2. It was extremely different quality. I said nothing, but when it was YN birthday, I acted. For months I researched doll making and restoring. I took a Barbie, and replaced her hair with some that matched hers and painted the eyes. I then hand sewed several custom outfits, and gave each a blue whale theme (her favorite animal). As a cosplayer, this wasn't that hard. \n\nOn her birthday, YN was ecstatic. But her sister was obviously not. I didn't pay attention to her, instead focusing on making sure YN liked her gifts. But only a few days later, her parents called me, telling me that I needed to make ON a doll as well. I said I'd get her one on her next birthday. They said no, she needed it immediately because she'd been upset that her sister's doll was customized unlike her store bought ones, and was mad that YN wouldn't share. I told them again that it was a project, and I'd make her one next year. They both accused me of not caring about ON's feelings. I got mad, saying that neither of them cared about being fair when YN was playing with a troll doll that was supposed to 'look like her'. This was a gift meant to make YN feel special, and I wasn't going to cheapen it because ON was pouting. I hung up, but started to wonder: AITA?", "assistant": "NTA, this is an incredibly sweet thing for you to do for your niece! Good on you for stepping up for your niece when her parents are obviously not.

You could always turn it into a special thing that you do for and maybe eventually with your YN, if she’s interested!"}

I was diagnosed with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) when I was 18 and often have fainting spells. My boyfriend knows this and has been there to witness quite a few episodes during our relationship. Every Tuesday we spend the day together since it is one of the few times during the week to hang out for a full day due to our weird schedules. So we decided to go shopping together since we had just gotten paid and it was something to do on a Tuesday. My boyfriend is one of 4 children, the only boy so his family isn't the most welcoming to me as I am heavily tattooed and have multiple facial piercings. His oldest sister (26F) tends to jump into hysterics over small things and enjoys causing drama quite frequently. The mall day was no different than the usual hysterics for his sister. She called my boyfriend in a panic claiming she had broken her ankle and she couldn't walk. Before this phone call, I had started showing symptoms of an oncoming POTS flare and had been asking him to get a salty snack and go sit down somewhere. As soon as he gets this phone from his sister, he immediately books it through the mall trying to get the car. I was struggling to keep up and my flare-up started to get worse, my vision had started to tunnel, and from my perspective; everything was spinning quite a bit. Finally, I was able to get him to slow down and start asking some basic medical questions, trying to see if a trip to the emergency room was necessary. (Context: I have a long history of injuries and have worked quite closely with physical therapists and orthopedic specialists) He couldn't answer any of the questions because he hadn't asked any questions, just started booking it. Finally, my flare had reached its peak and we had come to a flight of stairs. I stopped at the top and gripped the handrail to steady myself a bit. He started yelling at me about something, can't fully remember that part. We got a salty snack but continued to book it through the mall, not allowing me to sit or even get any salt in my system. We got to the ER and he insisted on carrying his sister into the ER. Turns out the \"broken ankle\" was just a sprain and I am genuinely unsure how to feel about all of this. I felt my safety was at risk since he acted as if this was the worst thing ever to happen and that he \"needed to rescue her\" (More context, she's married and her husband didn't even rush home from work for this) and had forgotten his girlfriend who was 2 seconds from passing out down a flight of stairs. My boyfriend and I got into a huge fight because I feel that critical thinking should have been used since we probably could have avoided a lot of the confusion and hysterics if more questions had been asked and if his sister hadn't acted as if someone died. I also feel that there is something else going on due to other instances of previous arguments about his family's behavior.", "assistant": "INFO: What do you do to manage your flares when you aren't with your boyfriend?

Me and all my sisters are very close in age and we have always been so close growing up. We had to share everything our whole lives due to my parents not having a lot of money. We grew up pretty well though from what i can remember, we had what we wanted and needed. As we got older we all started to do our own things such as sports or school events and still lived in the same house but were not so close. \n\nMy sister started to not care so much about her appearance and hygiene once we hit middle school, i figured it was because our elementary school required uniforms so we did not have to worry about school outfits , the middle school did not require uniforms. She would come to school wearing the most ridiculous things and hair messy no shower and teeth not brushed. This continued throughout middle and high school. as she got older she continued not to care and started to really become unpresentable and started to develop a strong odor. This had went on for so long that now if she showered the odor does not go away. My parent have had talks with her in the past about how she smells and how important it is to keep yourself clean and presentable but she would just ignore them. All she does is eat and sleep , doesn't care what she looks like, smells like. Goes out in public looking a hot mess, Dirty clothes, dirty hair, teeth brown from not brushing them ever. \n\nShe eventually went off and had 2 kids that she also does not wash, they always have dirty clothes on , hair is matted from not being brushed or washed, sends the kids to school like this to. My parents would give the kids a bath whenever they would babysit but it wasn't often. My mom would talk to her about her hygiene and why it was so hard for her to wash herself and my sister told her she does wash herself and this is what she would say anytime mom or dad would bring it up.

When i finally got my own place i told her she is not welcome because she smells and her kids smell and that i don't want them sitting on any of my furniture because it will smell like them.

I listened to her for around 20 minutes and she told me I was being quiet. My response was that she clearly needed to vent and I didn't want to interject. That was mostly true but I also think my sister is a little insane for thinking she'd get to have a nice neat little family given the craziness in her family.\n\nFor context: My sister had her first child at 18, my nephew Shane (18m). She dated Shane's dad for a while and found out when Shane was 1 that her boyfriend had another girl pregnant and so they broke up. My sister and the other mother both got arrested for fighting. And she swore she would never let that woman or her child near Shane. She got married at 21 and had two more kids Kadie (15f) and Rye (13m). She filed for divorce straight after Rye was born and her ex-husband is nowhere in sight since. A year later she met another man, who had a baby with someone. My niece Lily (12f) is not my sister's bio child but she raises her as her own (though unofficially since she's not adopted). Kadie got married again had Milo (9m) with that husband and got pregnant with Sage (7f) while married but her ex-husband is not the father. Her youngest bio (so far) is Nile (5m) and his father is not in the picture either.\n\nMy sister is married again.

But he treats this child like his own.\n\nThe household has many complicated relationships and divided loyalties. There are complications with some of the other parents involved and other children involved. It's too long and complicated to get involved in. But even among my sisters children, they are not all cohesive close siblings and some resentments exist for one reason or another.\n\nAnyway, Lily was venting to me. She said nobody she knows has a family so incapable of getting together as hers. She asked me why I thought that was and I said very blended families are more complex. She told me there are people with bigger blended families than hers. I told her bigger doesn't always mean having as many others involved as hers. Then she said again they're all a family though and they act like they don't want to be and that's when I said probably because it's more of a circus than a family.\n\nMy sister told me that was really unkind and untrue, that they are a family, even if others can't see it.

I thought because of that, and because I have been helping with venue preperations (I'm doing the photo slideshow, background animations for 2 screens and lighting for interactive dancefloor) I would not need an extra gift on top of that. However, my friends who are also in the wedding now told me that it would be a real AH move to show up without an extra gift (typically 100€ per person, so 200€ for both of us).\n\nBefore I go and talk to the bride about it, I wanted to get some outside perspective.

The flat has 3 bedrooms so I decided to get roommates so that it wasn't as expensive, and also to have some company which I find better than living alone.\n\nI've had the same roommates for the past 3 years and we very quickly became best friends but they both left to go study abroad. I looked for new roommates and found these two girls that I'll call Mary and Haley. They both moved in about a month ago. We got to know each other and I became good friends with Haley, but not as much with Mary because she's more reserved so she tends to stay in her room.\n\nI have 3 rules for the flat: no loud noises after 11pm on weekdays because we all have school or work; if one of us is not sleeping at home she tells the others (so that we don't worry); and when someone is showering you have to wait for the end of their shower before you can take one. That's because the plumbing in the flat is old and doesn't work super well so when two people shower at the same time the person that was showering first gets cold water. And then obviously, keep the place clean, but that doesn't really have to be said. I've had these rules with my previous roommates and everything went well.\n\nMary doesn't really respect the shower rule. Normally, what we do is we scream \"shower\" before getting in, and then we scream \"over\" when we're done. But there were a few times when Mary went into the shower before the other person was done. I completely understand that she wasn't really used to the rule as much as I was so it probably wasn't intentional, and it was really hot so taking a cold shower wasn't a problem, so I just casually reminded her but I didn't really say anything.\n\nYesterday, I was coming home from work a bit late and it was raining really hard so when I got home I went straight to the shower. I really wanted a nice hot shower because I was really cold and tired, but not even 2 minutes after I got in the shower the water turned cold. I had shampoo in my hair so it wasn't ideal. I got out to see why it was cold and I heard another shower running, it was Mary. I had to wait until she was done to go back in the shower and finally have hot water.\n\nToday I sort of confronted her about it and told her that it was kind of annoying and that it would really be better if she followed the rule. She told me that I was controlling and was trying to monitor when they showered and everything they did. I asked Haley if she felt the same way and she said no, and I also don't feel like I try to control anything, or like the rules that I have are unreasonable. Mary left right after the argument and hasn't been responding to our texts. I really want to fix it but I'm also not sure if I'm in the wrong or not.\n\nSorry if this is not clear, English isn't my first language and the characters are limited so if you need clarification I'll answer in the comments.\n\n  \nEDIT/UPDATE: Mary came home a while ago and we sat down to talk about the whole thing. She really apologized and listened and it was honestly great. She told me many things, the first one being that she was in a very bad mood yesterday and this morning for personal reasons and she apologized for that. She said that she would try to really be a better roommate from now on. We also talked about the rules and what we thought was appropriate (with Haley) and now have a whole system. And lastly she told me that she was feeling a bit excluded because Haley and I get along really well while she's less social and has been struggling a bit more, so we've really talked and tried to get to know each other. In other words, all's well that ends well, thankfully, and I think I might've even gotten a new friend because of this whole thing. I'd also like to thank everyone who was nice and gave constructive advice!", "assistant": "NTA, because there is a real problem when two showers are going at the same time, you’ve explained it, and have a system in place to deal with it. \n\nIt may be that she doesn’t mind because she’s never experienced being the first shower and losing hot water when a second shower is turned on. \n\nI can only suggest that you provide her with that experience once or twice. Then have a house meeting and go over ground rules together and see if all agree on then, want to add any, remove any and vote. Majority rules. \n\nThat’s better than saying you set the rules because your parents own the place. It will feel like she gets an equal say. Which is fair."}

We are both working and my husband earns more than me. From the start of our marriage, we agreed to keep a joint bank account and a personal bank account. In this way, we are able to share with the responsibilities of covering our family expenses and have our own money for personal needs.\n\nRecently, my BIL (41M) shared the news that his SIL that lives overseas is getting married. Her immediate family in the country has been invited to attend the wedding. Her only sister, my BIL’s wife, is expected to be there. The trip will require visa and of course, plane tickets. As we know traveling is a bit expensive. My BIL has to pay for his plane tickets and visa processing as not all the expenses can be covered by his SIL. For this, my BIL is asking (not borrowing) money from my husband to fund his travels. My husband was planning to give out but he would take it from our joint account and not his personal account. I firmly said no and told him that if he wants to help he can get money from his personal account and give what he can afford. I also said that if his BIL cannot afford the trip then he shouldn’t be joining. His wife can go with her family to attend the wedding. \n\nMy husband is now upset as he said that I said no and even mentioned that I was a bit insensitive as my family side was never in the situation to ask extra money from us. I told him that I do help out with my family side’s expenses in case of emergency but I never touch our joint account in helping them.\n\nMy BIL is still pestering my husband for his “contribution” but my husband is still silent on how much to give.\n\nSo, AITA in this situation?\n\n\n⭐️UPDATE! (editing this original post for update)⭐️\n\n\nFirst off, thank you for the advice, feedback and concerns. A lot of you were asking how much is the cost of the trip. We are from Asia and the wedding will be in the US. The cost of plane ticket and travel expenses is quite high. Their plan is stay for another 2 weeks after the wedding. All-in-all estimated cost is around USD 2500.\n\nMy husband and I had a discussion on this matter. I was relieved when he admitted that it was wrong of him to think about using money from our joint account. He apologized for it and on how he reacted when I said no to the request. He assured me that he has not touch our joint account. I’ve checked our account and sure enough there was no fund transfer recorded.\n\nMy husband initially thought of our joint account as he didn’t have enough money to the BIL’s request. I honestly don’t know how much he has in his personal account. It is his money. He also doesn’t know how much I have on my own account. He feels that he needs to provide as he earns more than the rest of his siblings. I told him that if it is an emergency we can help. In this case, it is not an emergency or a priority. He shouldn’t feel bad or burden himself about setting boundaries. We end our discussion with him still open to pitch in but only around USD 200. He will get the money from his personal account. \n\nIn the evening, we had a dinner with his side of the family. The topic of the trip came up. BIL was excited and jokingly asked solicitation from his siblings. It was a good thing my MIL (their mom), my husband and another BIL (their other brother) told him off and said that if he wants to go then he needs to fund his trip. BIL awkwardly laughs it off and was saying about getting commission/bonus at work. My other SIL (married to the other brother) secretly informed me that BIL also made demand to the other brother. I just hope and pray that he does find other ways instead from asking or soliciting from families.", "assistant": "NTA. I see a lot of red flags here. The purpose of joint accounts is so each person can spend their own money how they want. If it’s a joint expenditure then there’s negotiations involved. As this is his family and not yours, there’s no reason why you should have to contribute anything at all. \n\nI’m guessing because of the separate nature of your accounts he doesn’t know how much you have and vice versa. There are a few scenarios that could be at play here - none of which is good:\n1. He sucks at saving money and doesn’t have it to give but the pressure is killing him \n2. He has enough money but doesn’t want to decrease his savings to fund someone else’s trip\n3. He agreed to separate accounts to keep your hands off his money but believed he can manipulate you into spending money for his purposes\n\nIn all cases he’s looking out for himself. Stay strong. Say no. If you break down now you’re inviting him to guilt trip you until you have no money left and he has all the money."}

Since my husband and I have been living with my husband's brother, FIL decided that when the neighbor's house went on the market for a steal, he'd buy us the house. After consulting with his financial planner, the decision was made to have both FIL and my husband on the title/deed to the house. We would pay all taxes and utilities, and when FIL passes, husband would inherit the house. \n\nHere's where it gets messy.  The house needs a lot of work. Originally, husband and I were going to be responsible for improvements and repairs, so I started meeting with contractors and getting estimates for the work. My husband doesn't know much about home repair or renovation, and I do (my family has renovated multiple old homes) so he's been letting me handle all of the work with the contractors. Even so, FIL will not speak directly to me about anything related to the house. My poor husband has to play messenger, telling me what his dad wants to do, then telling his dad that I've actually got it handled, and want to do something different. \n\nThe final straw came today when my husband relayed to me that his dad has said that any permanent changes to the house that cost more than $5,000 have to be approved by him. Even if we're paying for them, he wants to sign off on any/all decisions, including tile colors, light fixtures, etc. So I forwarded all of my communication with the contractor we'd chosen (haven't signed anything yet) and said that if he wants to make the decisions, then he can make ALL the decisions. He will own the house, and we will sign a rental lease when the work is done. He'll have to pass city inspections for rental units, and abide by all state and local rental law. \n\nNow he's mad, and I'm ungrateful, selfish and controlling. At this point, I don't even want the house anymore. I'm ready to take the cat and go stay with my brother, but I don't actually want to leave my husband, I'm just sick of catering to his dad's whims. \n\n*One day later* Thanks for the gut check guys. I read through most of your comments although I didn't reply to most of them. I realize how incredibly privileged we are to be in this position. I never had any intention of doing any work on the house without FIL's approval, but we've already discussed what we were going to do, and he agreed that I should go ahead and find a contractor. Then he changed the rules. \nI had dinner with my MIL (divorced from FIL) last night to commiserate about what a butthead he can be.

He was a know it all who prided himself on his intelligence, which for some reason attracted Alba. \n\nAt the time Alba would sometimes tease me that I could do better than Vince, and would offer to set me up with one of Leo’s law school buddies, but I would always refuse and she eventually dropped the subject. \n\nAlba and Leo are currently going through a nasty divorce that stems from him cheating on her, quite frankly he is dragging her through the mud and is using connections to try and leave her as penniless as possible. \n\nAs we were chatting and catching up Alba began to express concern over the fact that my eldest son (7M) was recently diagnosed with dyslexia, Alba began telling me how she is worried that my son will be academically challenged like his father and what that could entail for his future. Before I could respond she told me how I should have married someone smart while I had the chance so I would have kids like hers. (Albas son is an incredibly bright boy and a straight A student).\n\nI told Alba her advice was unnecessary and reminded her where marrying for intelligence got her, I then proceeded to tell her that I would rather have my son grow up to be an honest, hardworking person like his father than an academically gifted jerk who wasn’t smart enough to know sleeping with his secretary could have consequences on his marriage like her husband. \n\nAlba was deeply hurt by what I’ve said and stormed out with her son. Some mutual friends are now chiming in and are telling me that\nI was too harsh on Alba for using her failing marriage to prove my point and should apologize. \n\n___________\n\nSmall update: first of all I want to thank you all for your replies :) \n\nI wanted to address a couple of things, many of you asked why Alba and I remained friends despite her previous remarks. Alba and I grew apart during our third year in university, we only remained friends by association since we have a lot of shared mutual friends. \n\nWe became close again after our sons started playing basketball together at the local community center and became friends. I figured that becoming a mother made her more mature and she didn’t give me any reason to suspect otherwise. \n\nI’ve decided to send her a message saying that the way she spoke about my husband and son was unacceptable and therefore she is no longer welcomed in my home, however, I don’t want our sons to lose their friendship and therefore I’m willing to remain civil around the kids and still organize play dates. She didn’t reply to me just yet, but I truly hope she loves her son enough to put her ego aside and remain civil for the sake of our kids.\n\nI’ve yet to notify Vince about this entire situation since he is vigorously studying for an important quiz that’s coming up next week, and I know that if he heard what Alba said about him and our boy it would make him upset and he won’t be able to continue studying properly. Unless something crazy happens in the meantime I’ll probably update him next week after he’s done with the quiz.", "assistant": "NTA - Alba was enjoying the view from her high horse after being dragged through the mud. She thought “here is my opportunity to show I’m still better than someone else” and took a way lower blow than you did. \n\nShe attacked your innocent young child’s intelligence and basically said his future accomplishments won’t matter when compared to her own kid. You on the other hand went after an obnoxious, cheating, AH whom she chose to be with. \n\nHopefully Alba can get over herself cuz otherwise her son will have no friends."}

We decided to take a trip to visit her family in another state, a 5-hour flight each way. I was dreading it a little, to be honest, because her mom (50F) can be… a lot.\nAnyway, we get to the airport and check in. Turns out, the airline messed up our seat assignments and my girlfriend and I are in different rows. No big deal, we figure we’ll ask someone to switch. Then her mom pipes up and says, “Oh, no, MY baby can’t possibly sit with a stranger for FIVE HOURS! You switch with me!”\nNow, I was already in the middle seat, which nobody likes. Her mom was in the aisle seat of the row in front of me. So basically, she wanted me to switch from a middle seat to a middle seat, just so she could be next to her adult daughter.\nI politely declined, saying I didn’t want to be in the middle seat for that long. Her mom went OFF. Started ranting about how I was being disrespectful, how I clearly didn’t care about her daughter, how I was ruining the trip before it even started. My girlfriend was awkwardly quiet the whole time.\nEventually, her mom stormed off in a huff and sat by herself. My girlfriend and I got to sit together after all because someone else offered to switch. But the whole flight was tense, and her mom keeps making snide comments about me.\nSo, Reddit, AITA for refusing to switch seats?\n\nEDIT: Sorry lol, I  wasn’t clear enough, her mom and dad live in our state.

AITA for not wanting to use my inheritance to pay for building my husband’s sisters a home on our farm?\nMy husband (52) and myself (50) have been married for 31 years. We purchased his parents farm several years ago and paid for it with a mortgage. We have since paid that mortgage off. We also built our forever home on the farm and it is also paid for and we raise cattle on the farm. \nHis family is always asking for help. His sisters specifically and a couple of his nephews. For context, we took care of his father, mother, and Down’s syndrome sister when nobody else in his family would take care of them. We were the only ones of his siblings who still had young children at home but we felt that if we didn’t take care of them the state was going to step in and take them away. In my family you take care of your family so we took them in and never looked back. \nHowever I think his family resented us for this and somehow feels like they are owed something because we own the family farm. And for some reason my husband thinks he has to take care of his other sisters even though there is nothing wrong with them except they have low IQs. \n\nI have inherited a decent amount of money from my parents. My husband doesn’t know the specifics and is upset that I won’t disclose the amount. He doesn’t have access to the account. He wants me to take some of the money and build a house on our farm (his family farm) for his sisters to live in so they won’t have to pay rent anymore or live in apartments. He wants us to pay their property taxes and insurance because “they won’t be able to afford that” but they can pay their utilities. He doesn’t want to charge them rent. \n\nWhy should I use my inheritance that my parents worked their butts off to earn and pass on to me so that my husband’s lazy sisters can sit in a brand new house on their family’s farm and never have to pay property tax or insurance or rent? I feel like this is my money and I shouldn’t have to spend it on his family. \n\nI want to put the majority of it in trust funds to our two children so I can pass it on to them. \nAnd to be honest I am seriously thinking about just taking my inheritance and getting a divorce and living happily ever after. \nSo…..AITA????", "assistant": "NTA. Congrats for putting your inheritance monies in a separate account in just your name so that it is never co-mingled with marital monies.  Always keep it separate or else your husband will have a claim to half of it should you divorce.  If you use any of it on items you own jointly, well then your husband automatically owns half of whatever amount you invested from your inherited monies.  Beware of this pitfall.  You may, of course, choose to do this at some point, but know what it means -- you've given away part of those monies and cannot ever reclaim it.  \n\nYour parents left you your inheritance to you to spend as you choose.  They did not leave it to your husband and certainly not to his sisters.  He is wrong to try to guilt you into spending it on his family, even if they weren't lazy. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't blame you for leaving a man who continued to insist you spend your inheritance on his sisters who, according to you, are lazy and not helping themselves adequately.  Hopefully though you can resolve this issue without resorting to that unless, of course, you otherwise no longer wish to be married to this man."}

In my opinion, the job is pretty simple. She gets there at 6, dinner is at 6:30 (always mac and cheese. I make the sauce before she gets there so she just has to boil the pasta and add the sauce), after dinner they get to play until 7-7:15, they each get a melatonin gummy, they watch bluey until 7:30-7:45, then everyone uses the bathroom, brushes their teeth, and goes to bed. All of the girls share a room, their pajamas and comfort items are laid out for them, and I have a stack of books out for bedtime stories. Everyone gets tucked in then sitter reads 3-4 stories until everyone’s asleep. Evie occasionally has a hard time falling asleep so I told the sitter if she’s not asleep by the 4th story sitting on her bed and rubbing her back tends to get her to sleep within a few minutes. Sitter turns off the lights, turns on the night light and sound machine, and gets to hang out on the couch until I get home. \n\nI have all 3 girls sharing a room for a reason.

My friend told her to lay down quietly or sleep in the guest room and Evie started to cry. My friend picked her up, put her in the guest room, and stayed in front of the door to the girls room to prevent her from going back to bed. \n\nWhen I got home close to midnight Evie was still awake and was crying her eyes out. I didn’t find out what happened until the next morning.

No one else in my family stepped up, so I offered to take my niece in while my sister did drug treatment to avoid jail. From the beginning, my niece, then around 10, didn't want anything to do with her mom. I thought that was odd; but over the first few months I had her, my niece opened up about her mom having treated her very poorly. I sought a guardianship for my niece, and told my sister that I would not willingly send my niece back to her unless my sister got off the drugs and sorted her life out.\n\nMy sister initiated a legal fight with me to terminate the guardianship. I grew to love this kid like my own, and I didn't want to send her back to a bad environment. It cost me six figures over the course of a year-and-a-half in legal fees. I won. I managed to marshal substantial evidence of my sister's ongoing substance abuse and the court relied upon the report of a court-appointed guardian ad litem who reported favorably about my niece in my care and about my niece's negative view of her mother.\n\nAt some point in the legal process--as I was shelling out five-figure monthly legal bills--I learned that, as my niece's guardian, I was entitled to child support, so I filed the forms to seek it, and won it.\n\nThe state oversees the support award, and is apparently pretty thorough in seeking it. Garnishing paychecks and bank accounts. Now--years on--I am starting to get pressure from other family to forgive the child support. I have family reaching out to me saying my sister is doing better and just can't get ahead having to give up portions of her paycheck every month. With back amounts, it's like 30k in back support that I am owed. I don't need it, really, if I'm being honest. I make a good living--better than anyone else in my family has done.  \n  \nIn all likelihood, sister's debt it will never be paid in full. But I don't want to let it go. I've started telling relatives, \"Hey--that's great that you want to help \\[sister\\]--why don't *you* pay me her 30k debt plus the present value of the award until niece is 18--and then I'll forgive \\[sister's\\] obligation.\" Relatives have been huffy at that response.  \n  \nMy sister initiated a fight with me knowing full well she was back on drugs, and lied about it, and got caught in open court. It was all a waste of a large amount of money, in my prime years, that I would have otherwise saved and set aside to retire on, or pay for my niece's education. I'm still mad about it, and my sister can owe me it forever for all I care. AITAH?", "assistant": "NTA. You need to remind your family that the child support your sister is paying is not for you, her brother. It is for her daughter. The fact that you can afford to pay for the daughter’s care is irrelevant. That money can go into a college fund if you want. Also, where is the child’s father in this picture? He owes child support, too. Kudos to you for stepping up to care for your niece. You have spared her from a lifetime of harm."}

My husband told me Saturday that he'd had an affair and had a kid from it. Our kids are 14m and 10f and this child is 9f. Something happened to her mother in the last couple weeks (I was a little too busy screaming at him to listen to the details) and he was leaving to go get her. My daughter came to me crying saying that he told her she had to share her room and her stuff with this girl for now. I called my parents and they agreed to her staying in their guest room (2 bedroom condo so my son and I are staying at the house). \n\nWe packed her stuff and Monday my parents, sister, BIL, and nephews helped us move ALL her stuff to my parents place. They also helped put locks on my bedroom and my son's bedroom. We moved all my husband's stuff from my bedroom to the 4th bedroom that he used as a home office. \n\nYesterday evening my husband got home with his affair kid. He got mad about all the stuff being gone and nothing being left for her. She's from a much warmer area and doesn't have clothes for the cold here (we live in the northern part of the US).

Not give up HIS home office to create a bedroom for her?\n\nEverything he was planning on was guaranteed to undermine your daughter’s sense of security, safety, and sense of her place within your family. \n\nYeah, the affair daughter is here and needs to be taken care of.

Emily was 3 years older than me and she died when I was a few months old. My parents never recovered. My whole childhood I was in the shadows of the child they lost. I get that grief does things to people and that losing a child is the worst loss a parent can suffer, but it was like I didn't exist most of the time. They talked about Emily all the time. Sometimes they could acknowledge she was gone but more often than not she was talked about like she was still around. The most attention I got from my parents is when they force fed words about how much I loved Emily. It never came natural for me to say \"I love Emily and I miss her so much\". I didn't know Emily. But I did feel haunted by her. I had a big photo of Emily on the wall opposite my bed growing up. They wanted me to fall asleep to my sister looking over me. It always felt creepy. But they had photos of her in every room, even the bathroom. I remember trying to take the photo in my room down and my parents had a hugely explosive reaction. Like I'm talking they yelled so loud the neighbors came to check on us.\n\nEmily's room was never touched after she died and sometimes my parents would sit in there for hours sometimes. I was also forced to sit with them in there sometimes. But I had to be very careful because I couldn't touch anything or make the room filthy.\n\nExtended family were always so caught between being nicer to me to try and make up for my parents or coddling my parents and putting the weight of their grief and Emily's death on my shoulders. They would tell me not to be so harsh on my parents when they (my parents) would let me down. My parents could never celebrate anything I did. My extended family tried to fill that gap... but sometimes it felt like they came just to lecture me about compassion and understanding.\n\nI did good through school despite getting no help or support from my parents and I got a full scholarship to college. Before I left my extended family came over to say goodbye and \"celebrate\" a little, because there could be no celebrating me at my parents house. My parents had these photos of Emily for me to take. They told me I'd need them for my dorm. But I left them behind. I didn't want to take photos of Emily. I wanted to get away from them and that might seem really unfair. My parents realized the next day and I got a text from my dad calling me all sorts of names for leaving them behind.

My parents divorce was not amicable. I (16f) don't know all the details obviously, but I know that bad blood exists on both sides. And if you want my suspicions. I think they divorced so badly because my dad wanted to set up his own business but my mom didn't want that to happen right after me. My dad owns his own business ,actually he owned two and the first one he had to close up. The first one he started right after the divorce which is why I suspect what I do. My dad also complained once or twice that mom never supported him.\n\nSo there are issues between my parents. When I'm with my mom you would never know it. She does not vent about dad, badmouth him, or try to hide the fact they were married and had me together. She has some photos of us before the divorce in our living room among the rest of the family photos. And while I have issues with my stepdad and he's not my favorite person ever, he has never complained or tried to erase the fact he married a woman who had a kid with someone else. He never got that part wrong despite our issues.\n\nBut my dad's house is so very different. It got worse after he married my stepmom. I'm not supposed to mention my mom at all, they don't let me have anything there that my mom bought, even my favorite plushy that mom bought me as an infant. I can't have a single photo of my mom or my half siblings on her side. I used to have a little pinboard of photos and my dad and stepmom went into my room in the past and removed all traces of mom. My stepmom even said she burned the photos of mom. They have told me in their house they do not want to see my mom and my room is not a compromise. So of course I don't like being here. I spend 50% of my time here, and no the courts won't let me stop coming and they would punish my mom if I stop and the judge told my mom if she does not force me to go, and stay, she would pay. After our last attempt a few months ago dad started telling me I don't treat my room like my room or I don't act like it's my home. He asked me why I wanted to leave \"our home\".\n\nOn Sunday my dad and stepmom told me I act like I'm a guest in their house instead of part of the family and that it's my home.

You're not even allowed a childhood plushy that brings you comfort because it happened to be purchased by your mom 16 years ago!\n\nYour bedroom there probably feels like a hotel room, except even hotel rooms let you have trinkets that remind you of home.

She raised concerns about how vulnerable a position it is and that she doesn't want to solely depend on him for money. He wanted me to talk to her and convince her by telling her how it worked out for me.\n\nI said I understood where she was coming from, and being a housewife is incredibly risky and vulnerable, especially if he leaves her and she's been out of the labour force for a while.

It was a fantastic, amazing and romantic vacation all up to the point when my partner suggested we ask a stranger to take a picture of us in a \"fake proposal\" in front of the Eiffel Tower. When he asked this, my heart started beating so fast, I immediately assumed he was saying \"fake proposal\" as a ruse for a real proposal, which is not something we have talked about yet. \n\nI think I just said \"wait what do you mean?\" and he said that proposal pictures in this spot were really popular and that we should \"take the opportunity\" while we can. I said that I wasn't really interested in a fake proposal picture and that I thought it was weird that he would suggest that. We moved on pretty quickly and went to dinner. \n\nWhen we got back to our hotel that evening I asked him about it, since it had been on my mind and I could tell that I had actually really upset him. I asked him explicitly \"were you planning on actually proposing to me and I ruined it?\" and he said no, that he doesn't think we are ready for that step (and for the record, I agree. Our relationship was long distance for the first 8 mo and I am planning on moving in with him when my lease is up in January). He said that he always thought the proposal picture in front of the Eiffel Tower was really romantic and that he's worried whenever he actually does propose it won't be as romantic as Paris, so he wanted to get the picture while we could. \n\nI apologized but told him that I was only interested in actual proposal pictures, and that I would love them whenever/wherever it happened. He has been pretty crestfallen since this conversation and I really feel like I genuinely ruined something for him. I called some friends when we got home and got mixed advice, some agreeing that it was a really odd request, and some saying I should have just taken the fake proposal photo which would have been no harm done. \n\nAITA for not taking the photo with him?", "assistant": "NTA. It is weird. And also tone deaf on his part. Like, what was he planning on doing with the photos? Anyone seeing them online would instantly think it was genuine before reading any accompanying text that explains it’s “fake”. Which is just a dickish move in itself. \n\nThe only way it would make sense is if he actually was planning on proposing and is too proud now to admit it. But you don’t “spring” a fake proposal idea for that. You just ask a stranger to take a few photos, and they’ll quickly realise what’s happening. \n\nFake proposals aren’t romantic. Even in front of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAnd if he’s bummed because he genuinely just wanted to do a fake proposal for shits and giggles and you said no, then boohoo, he’s an adult, tell him to get over it."}

It's something our family did when my siblings and I were kids too. We'd have grandparents over and we'd all have a nicer dinner together. When my siblings and I grew up we still did it only instead of what happened before, where branches broke off over time and did their own, they decided we should include partners/spouses and our kids as a whole in one. By the time I was 19 the family had decided they would take turns hosting each month to lessen the burden.\n\nMy wife was excited to be a part of them at first. We started during our relationship. I did the cooking to start and then she took over after a while because she wanted to. My family had seemingly got along with my wife before this point but they were overly harsh of her cooking (with the exception of my two younger siblings). She tried to make them happy but no dice. I told them they could be kinder. They said she should cook better or cook different things. My wife didn't make anything they don't eat. But nothing was right. She grew frustrated and I grew suspicious. \n\nSo we hosted a couple of months ago and I told my wife we were going to pretend I did the cooking. Just to see. She told me she felt like they just weren't fond of her food. I pointed out nobody had the same amount of complaints as them and they even criticized the steak and potatoes they all seemed to go crazy for. She went along with the plan and when my family thought I'd cooked it? They loved it. Said it was so good my wife had decided to let a real talent take over. That it was so nice to have something a little different (curry) and all this very lovely stuff. My younger brother and sister weren't fooled. But they enjoyed watching the rest of the family dig a hole. When the rest of my family heard it was my wife's food and not mine? They tried so hard to backtrack on all the nice stuff. The rest of the dinner went in tense silence and my wife's eyes were opened. I told her I was done with these dinners and she was my priority. She felt a little bad. I told her we could have dinners with my younger brother and sister sometimes. It's less stress anyway.\n\nWhen we didn't show up to last months dinner or this one, my parents and siblings started asking questions. I told them each time we weren't going again but missing two made it sink in. They told me we need to be there. I said never again. My wife doesn't deserve their disrespect. I told them they ruined what they wanted by being assholes to her. They said I was overreacting, making very relationship harming choices, and treating them badly for simply having issues with my wife's food. They also said to think of future kids and how they'll miss out. Some of it got to my wife a little which I have tried to reassure her about.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA\n\nThe irony! They were the ones who made the \"relationship harming choices\".\n\nWhen they were caught they doubled down instead of apologizing and checking in on the why of their behavior so they could grow and move past it.\n\nYou did right by your wife and your family."}

They have 3 kids together. My mom died when I was 8 but my parents were already divorced and I think my dad was already dating my stepmother at that point. Either that or he/they rushed the relationship because they assumed I would need a new mom because mine died. It was a crazy af time.\n\nMy dad and stepmother decided we needed therapy together because she was struggling and wanted to communicate some stuff to the two of us that she had not before. In therapy she started off talking about how she feels like she's second best or a consolation prize with me. She feels like I see her as less than a parent, less than a mother, and it hurts. She talked about marrying my dad expecting we would be so close and how she believed a newly motherless child would need someone else to fill in. But that the whole time we've known each other she feels like I do nothing but compare her to mom or dismiss her in favor of mom and leave her in second place a lot. She said she wanted to be more important to me than that. She wanted to mom in my eyes. She didn't want to feel like I would gladly toss her aside if my mom came back. I'll say now, in therapy she was called out for that. She was told it was cruel to toss that in my face when I'm old enough to be aware my mom is never coming back.\n\nShe spoke for several sessions about feeling second best/like the consolation prize and like I don't care for her at all. She brought up how I never hug her or how I correct anyone who mistakes her for my mom. Another thing was the fact I have never said I love you to her, she noticed that and she said many times she waited and waited for me to say it but it never came. She talked about how every mention of my mom hurts her down to her core because she can hear how much I love my mom. She admitted to hating my mom, to wanting to wave a magic wand and have me forget her so she's not coming in second to her always. There were lots more things said too.\n\nI was asked to address what she said for several sessions. But I knew it might come across as cruel if I did. So I refused to engage. But my dad kept pressing me on the issue and the counselor was trying to reassure me that I would not be penalized for speaking up. After a lot of pressing and then my stepmother got involved and told me to speak because we needed to work through this and she needed me to acknowledge her feelings and work on us coming together, I was honest. I said she was never second best or a consolation prize because she was never in the running. I never saw her as mom, I never considered her to be a possible new or second mom. I never ever looked at her in that way or wanted her to be that for me. And that she was always competing against my dead mom for nothing.\n\nMy dad and stepmother were so angry after I said all this.

There are always rows of empty seats at the time that I ride it in the afternoon.\n\nI use a light linen bag for work and I don’t want to put it on the floor or on my lap so I put it on the seat next to me (all the seats are pairs, two seats next to each other). I don’t mind anyone sitting next to me, but the bus is never close to full, so I use the space for my bag. \n\nYesterday during my commute, a lady got on the bus and grimaced at me. She gestured for me to remove my bag so she could sit next to me. As usual, there were so many empty seats. I wasn’t sitting in a disabled/reserved area — there were seats closer to the door. But whatever, I’m not confrontational, I removed my bag so she could sit. \n\nI sort of rolled my eyes when she sat down next to me and sighed, not to be obvious, but just because I got off an 8 hour shift, I was tired and wanted my own space, and SHE DIDNT HAVE TO SIT NEXT TO ME. She clearly noticed - she then said “You need to learn some manners.” \n\nAfter that I got up and moved to another seat, but the whole thing has been bothering me for a day.

When we first met, she was struggling financially and lived paycheck to paycheck. At one point, her car broke down and she had no transportation to work, so I would let her borrow my car and never asked her for gas money or anything in return. At the time, I was financially secure and was happy to help her out.\n\nAs the years went by, my financial situation changed & just like her, I began living paycheck to paycheck. By this time, she had started dating a guy she met online who revealed to her a few months into dating that he was a millionaire. They married shortly after and suffice to say she has not had to struggle since. There have been a few times I have asked to borrow money, which I have always paid back. It's usually not much, less than $25 or so each time, and she would always oblige with no problems until recently.\n\nThe last couple times I asked to borrow money, she said she didn't have it which I found odd. But then I asked to borrow $5 and she said the same thing and I thought it was odd that she told me she didn't have $5 to spare. I know that ever since she got married, her brothers and a couple other friends have tried taking advantage of her new-found wealth by asking to borrow money they never paid back and having her bail them out of situations they put themselves in that have cost her a lot of money.\n\nI started to think that maybe I had forgotten to pay her back money I owed her at some point, so I reached out to her to ask if that was the case. When she told me that wasn't the case (as in, I had always paid her back), I told her I felt hurt because it felt like if I needed her help with something (I used the example if I ended up in jail) that I couldn't reach out to her for help because she couldn't even let me borrow $5. She replied and said that just like her brothers, I needed to learn how to budget my money better and that she can't be the one to bail everyone out. She said when she was struggling, she had to work multiple jobs and did what she had to do.\n\nI replied and said that it was not fair for her to lump me in with her brothers as I have never done anything to take advantage of her & I never would have said something like that to her when I let her borrow my car & anytime she would ask me to borrow money when she was struggling.\n\nI told her I loved her but that I was ending the conversation and she replied that this is why money and friends should never mixed. Since then, she has reached out and said, \"I didn't deserve that conversation last night, I hope you know that\" to which I have not replied to and have no plans to. I am deeply hurt that she feels I was in the wrong, but I do not think I was the asshole here. I understand that I am not entitled to anyone's money, borrowed or not, but when she was in my shoes, I did everything I could to help her out. I could understand if I had asked to borrow a large amount of money, but I literally asked for $5.", "assistant": "NTA. Did I read the same post as everyone else, or did your friend make a bunch of accounts ragging you over $5.

Since we’ve been together, she keeps saying my boyfriend is awful, makes up situations that never happened, and tries to turn me or him against each other with exaggerated stories.\n\nEven when we first started dating (8 years), I was giving her money to help with her debts, which she never paid back. She spent half a year at home without working, and my boyfriend and I were practically supporting her. She eats a lot, weighs around 145 kg, and has many health issues (\"she has food because she has almost nothing else in her life\"). She hasn’t saved any money because she spends it all on food and sweets. She doesn’t deal with medications or medical treatments because she’s embarrassed in front of doctors about her “ugly clothes,” and she won’t buy new clothes because she spends all her money on food. She has incontinence, and whenever we suggest she seeks treatment, she gets offended. She spends excessive time in the bathroom, and her chronic cough echoes because the bathroom is directly across from our bedroom. This keeps my boyfriend awake, and sometimes he even sleeps in the living room to avoid being disturbed.\n\nLast Christmas (2024), she said she would move out so we could have privacy, because she constantly listens to us, even during sex. She claimed she was looking for a new place but insisted on paying the same rent she currently pays, which is absolutely impossible in this city. She refused to consider moving to a cheaper area, so I know she wasn’t really trying. She didn’t even actually save enough for the deposit, so my boyfriend and I had to cover it. We bought her a bed, a chair, and a TV. She’s moving into a new apartment, but now she wants a washing machine, a table, a better TV, and even our couch. She also wants to keep the keys to our apartment.\n\nI finally snapped, yelled at my boyfriend for not standing up to her, and told (shortly) my mother-in-law to f\\*ck off. She immediately started crying, saying I was being too harsh, and my boyfriend told me I overreacted and even told me I’m selfish. He also told me I should be grateful she’s finally leaving, and I am, but I’m frustrated by everything she has demanded from us, and I worry that in the future it could get even worse.\n\nAITA?\n\n**Edit for clarification:**\n\n1. English isn’t my first language, so I should have specified that she’s my *future* mother-in-law. She calls me her daughter-in-law even though we are not married with my bf. I’ve always called her my mother-in-law, so sorry for the confusion.\n2. About the debts: she only started paying them recently (10+ years after they were incurred), and some were forgiven. This is why we’re addressing it now; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to cover her own rent.\n3. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 8 years, but we’ve only lived together for 2. For the previous 6 years, I lived in university dorms and visited on weekends. I contributed financially with what I earned from part-time jobs during that time.\n\n4. Some people asked why we don’t just let her take the furniture she wants. To clarify: before I moved in, my boyfriend lived here with his mother, his brother and his brother’s pregnant fiancée. About 90% of the furniture at that time belonged to them (other is landlord's). When they moved out, his brother told their mother he never wanted to see her again (for the same reasons I struggle with her, didn't even invite her to their wedding). He and his fiancée took everything they had bought. After that, I moved in, and my boyfriend and I furnished the apartment ourselves with our own money. For example, I paid for the bed and TV in our bedroom, we split the cost of the fridge, etc. His mother hasn’t bought anything except a towel rack. So when she’s now asking for our couch, washing machine, and a “better TV,” she’s basically demanding things she never contributed to in the first place.", "assistant": "NTA\n\n\nYou and your boyfriend have been enabling this parasite for far too long.\n\n\n\nI would be giving your boyfriend an ultimatum.

Biological parents if I have to be honest about it but my parents are my grandparents to me. But I call them both grandparents and parents depending on the situation.\n\nMy biological parents had me in their mid 20s but they \"weren't ready to be parents\" and asked my grandparents to raise me at the last minute, like 2 days before I was born last minute. They (my biological parents) actually walked out of the hospital and just left me there. Called my grandparents first but they were gone by the time my grandparents got there.\n\nI grew up around my paternal family minus my parents. I didn't \"meet\" them until earlier this year. I'm close to aunts and uncles who are more like siblings in some ways but also like aunts and uncles. Cousins I'm close to as well.

They were amazing grandparents turned parents again.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago my biological parents returned and told the family they had kids. My grandparents didn't push me to interact or meet any of them so I stayed out of it. My grandparents only interacted twice. My biological parents chased after them to be more involved but my grandparents said no. The extended family didn't see them often either even though my biological parents really tried to act like it was all one big family around them again.\n\nThe discussion of inheritance and wills came up and my biological parents wanted to know if their kids had been added as equal grandkids and they said they heard I was being treated like a kid and why the hell was that happening. I was no more their kid than the other grandkids and I shouldn't take priority as a grandkid either since I was one of the oldest. I didn't need anything. My grandparents kicked them out and told them to get lost (in their more mature nature). This brought my biological parents to me and asking to have a serious talk and them blaming me for my grandparents not wanting to know their kids better. I rolled my eyes when they brought it up and it pissed them off and I just shut the door on them and my grandparents were outraged they approached me for the first time ever to shame me for their decisions that were not mine.

Based on what you're saying, it sounds like your biological parents are anticipating an equitable distribution of your grandparents wealth when they finally pass on.\n\nFrankly, in your biological parents' place, I'd worry more about being left out of the will completely. That's what your grandparents should do. First, they decided they weren't ready to be parents, so they dumped you onto their grandparents. Which is disgusting enough.\n\n\"Oh, gee. It's like, I'm not ready to be a mommy/daddy now. It's like, such a bummer. So, I think I'll just dump this kid on my parents and let them take care of the kid.\"\n\nReady or not, you are a parent. This is not a responsibility you can just pawn off on something else.\n\nCompounding their offense, when they decided they were ready, they didn't bother inviting you back into the fold. They just made more kids and left you where you are. If my parents did that to me, I would tell them in no uncertain terms that they are dead to me, and have no right to even speak to me, much less discuss inheritance.\n\nYour parents are greedy, selfish and immature.

They claimed everything to be a phase, that I'm confused, or that I have some other unresolved issues that cause me to think this.\n\nAbout two years ago I told my parents that I've picked a name (I'd been using a 'placeholder name' for over 2 years until that point).

My current name is the closest masculine version of that after 1 other version which I hate. \n\nYesterday, my parents found out that my second chosen name is a male version of my 'original' first name that pretty much sounds the same (think noa/noah). My parents hated it, which I find understandable since they've been struggling from the beginning with me changing my name at all. I specifically picked my name, both first and second, because I wanted to respect my parents and not stray too far from my birth name so that they'd find this pill slightly easier to swallow.\n\nMy dad said that I'm extremely disrespectful to make a mockery of their choice like that, and that not consulting with them makes it so much worse.

It's not my responsibility to take care of another person's dog. She also complained to this person about how I gave her dog meds at the wrong time once and I'm \"unreliable\", but I went back and found the text receipts where I asked her if it was ok to give the meds 30 minutes early so I could go out to lunch with a friend, and if not I would wait 30 more minutes, and she wrote back and said it was fine to give them early.

Eventually, it did, and now she is healthier than ever, but it made me take a bit more of an initiative in taking care of her. I have a big enclosed glass place that looks overlooks the garden, where I set up a place for her to stay, beds, food, water, toys, you name it, while also giving her an entrance so that she could come and go as she pleased.\n\nI'm a bit of a neat freak and don't like fur, so I didn't want to take her into the full house, but this was the least I could do. She would sometimes stand around the glass entrance to my house and meow there to come inside, but I never let her. Instead, I would go outside more and in the winter, go inside her side of the sunroom to play with her. Many people have come into my home, and none had anything bad to say about our arrangement, but recently, a friend of a friend who is into cats has told me that I was giving Milk a house cat treatment while deliberately keeping her as an outside cat, which was a bit cruel. I have never thought about it that way, and now I'm wondering, AITA for doing this?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the comments, everyone, I appreciate them all. After reading through them, I've decided that I'd try to get Milk to slowly get integrated into the full house. Today was her first time discovering my living room. I got her bed inside, and we watched some TV together. The fur is a lot for sure, but I'll do my best to clean up and also suck it up a little, too. Again, thank you, everyone.", "assistant": "NTA  \n  \nHello, I made an account just for this because I've caught several cats in my community. You're not an asshole! Milk is lucky to have any help at all out there, it's a cruel world for strays. However, if you want to do more for her, take her inside! Cats suffer living out there, and it'd be in her best interest to be allowed to live indoors, where she could have consistent food, play, love, and safety, where she could avoid any further wounds like the one you helped her through.\n\nIf you're unable/unwilling to keep her yourself, that's entirely reasonable, but if you want to give her the best chance at a long happy life, foster until she can be adopted by someone else who can make her the center of attention.\n\nP.S. Feral and stray cats are also the #1 cause of a decline in aviary biodiversity, so you'd be doing the birds a favor too!"}

After everything that happened with my child’s father they were still here after we went our separate ways then things started to get a little dicey after an incident that could have been fixed if someone communicated. All of a sudden I’m getting blocked and nobody is responding to anything. After I asked if my child’s father had/ about to have another kid they started acting weird. They wouldnt tell me, yes I asked the dad too. Mind you after I had just given birth the other woman started texting my phone telling me she’s pregnant and it’s a boy. I was basically getting harassed by the other woman and my own child was not out the hospital, due to being born too early. Fast forward to today one of the same people who blocked me for reasons unknown was buddy buddy with child at their own baby shower.

We ended up getting back together about a week later I didn’t think anything of it or wanted to tell him…\n\nwell I ended up getting pregnant and I know I’m grown and that my actions have consequences. I didn’t tell him until about four months into the pregnancy which I know is awful but he stated whether it’s his or not he wanted to be with me and will help me raise this child.\n\n We told our parents and his mom‘s reaction was “I can fly her to New Mexico for a abotrion since I work for Southwest” And his dad’s grandparents wanting that too ( we do not speak to them ). I am very against abortions unless it’s a serious medical situation. He told me she only said that to get on their grandparents good side because they’re VERY wealthy. I never wanted my child to see her after that comment but I put it aside thinking she was just being immature. \n\nMy son was born in June and we waited about three weeks for her to meet him because she kept blowing up our phones, asking for pictures and dying to meet him. We go down there (3 hours away) and she asked me if I needed anything. I told her know that I’ve got everything covered and bringing double of everything. We get there and she has bought newborn diapers and size one diapers and formula despite me telling her no I’ve got it covered. I knew this would be thrown back in my face eventually because that’s the type of people that they are. \n\nMe and the boyfriend ended up getting into an argument on the way home. We didn’t speak for a few days after and when we did, his mom tried to call me. He told me not to answer because he’s mad at his mom. I asked why he told me that she stated she was not buying anything else for this baby until we get  paternity test mind you this child looks exactly like him. I immediately told him I do not wish for her to receive pictures or FaceTime us anymore. Given that this was thrown back in my face after I told her we do not need anything. It is just really confusing for me. How we can go down there and she can play grandma and do all the sweet stuff and say “I love you” “you’re my pretty boy” to my son and then completely switch sides so I decided for my sons sake we will not be in contact with her because I do not want her to ever throw that in my son‘s face.He agrees we’re doing the right thing protecting our child from her .

He looks just like him and he wants to be w me regardless of he’s dad or not , I need to add way more abt his mom but will keep it short, She and his dad divorced when he was 7 due to her neglect , anytime something doesn’t go her way she gets very emotionally and verbally abusive and constantly talked down to the kids .

My (25f) boyfriend (28m)has an ice tea addiction - he only drinks one specific brand and flavor and this one only. Whenever he doesn't get it he's grumpy. I never had a problem with that, everyone has their little addictions and if his was only a specific type of ice tea, so be it.\n\nThe problem is, that ice tea is only available mainly in one supermarket chain, sometimes not available locally at all (we don't have a car). Luckily for him I work at a supermarket that usually has enough of it, so I always bring some with me after work (mind me I sometimes carry 6 - 8 bottles a 1,5 Liters and I have to walk and drive by train and bike from work to home).\n\nWhile he is overweight, I never cared about it much, only thing I worry is his health (heart problems). He promised trying to loose some weight and switch to water slowly, but whenever he doesn't drink his ice tea he gets headaches and migraines (he gets those quite often) and he says it's not easy to switch to water only since he is addicted to the sugar. I believe him, no doubt, but I know there has to be some way to change that. \n\nWe tried switching to Holy - since that's the only sugar free ice tea he drinks, but he always comes back to his ice tea.\n\nHERE IS MY PROBLEM: He always gets mad at me when I suggest drinking water (or holy) when his ice tea is not available or we don't have it at home at the moment.\n\nAnother thing bothering me is that he doesn't like to go to the supermarket by himself alone. He's always grumpy and complaining when I tell him I don't want to go out after work anymore (I am on my feet 8 hours a day at work while he has a homeoffice job) and I usually bring all the groceries with me after work. So when something is missing - like his ice tea - he always asks me to come with him, but I hate walking to go grocery shopping (I usually go by bike, but he doesn't have/want one).\n\nWe go grocery shopping together casually at least 3 times a week, but I don't see myself going every damn day. \n\nAnd I really refuse to see myself just joining him because he doesn't wanna go alone, especially when it is only to get his damn ice tea.\n\nAm I the asshole for calling him out that there are other drinking options at home (water, holy)?\n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to go grocery shopping after I got home from work when it's only to get him his ice tea?", "assistant": "NTA for all of it. You are enabling his drinking choices, though, and as long as you keep supplying, he'll keep demanding. Let him go get it himself, no matter how grumpy he gets. I bet you'll find one of two things: 1. he tapers off of the iced tea because he doesn't want to go himself to get it, or 2. he'll start looking and feeling better because he's going to have to get up and get it himself without a car. Either way, I think it's time for him to manage his own supply."}

We would be able to afford a good starter home with his help, and we scrimped and saved to add to it.\n\nExcept apparently HE meant “a sum of money good for a down payment for a house near us” where the cost of living is low. He did not ever mean a down payment for a home in Colorado, where my wife and I have lived since we were in college. He said he thought I would be “smart enough” to realize that we’d need to move somewhere with a lower COL than Colorado.\n\nHe keeps saying \"move to a cheaper city.\" Our lives are here. Our friends, our jobs, our hobbies. You can’t exactly leave your house and be up on top of a 14,000ft peak in 6 hours where my family is.\n\nI told him that we had never talked about moving back there, and we never would. That we would rather be stuck renting for a while longer than be stuck somewhere we didn’t want to be, and the “move to a cheaper city” wouldn’t work for us. He said “so be it” and gave us the amount and that was that. I expressed gratitude and thanked him for the money. It is still towards the goal.\n\nWell because of this shift in our finances, we have had to make a lot of changes to save up the rest of the money. We have had to cut out vacations, birthday gifts, holidays, etc. We won’t be traveling home for a few years. At our current rate, we should have an ok down payment by the end of next year (2025).\n\nMy Dad confronted us about this because we won’t come for a summer break trip and told me that I was being a selfish, entitled brat because I hadn’t gotten my way. That I was essentially punishing the rest of the family because we “assumed” what his gift would be.\n\nI told him that I was grateful for the amount he gave us, but that it means we do need to buckle down and save every penny if we want to be able to afford a house anytime soon. Even townhouses around us are easily over 400k, and that’s for the sketchy ones.\n\nBut is my Dad right? AITA?\n\n**Edit to add FAQ:**\n\nThere was no amount formally discussed.

We divorced about 10 years ago now because I feel like he regressed as a husband and a father during my second pregnancy and he was even worse when our younger son was born. He was acting like a high school or college kid or a single 20 something with no kids. He spent more time with friends than with us. His friends were also treating me more like his mom and expecting me to pick him up from their houses when they needed to get on with stuff.\n\nHe fought for 50% custody of our kids which he wasn't given and for the first two or three years he had every other weekend and a two week period during the summer with them as well as alternating holidays. He started being more involved and eventually he did get 50% custody. It was at that time I found out he got some woman pregnant and he realized with three kids he needed to get his act together. He ended up with full custody of his third child. Then he met his wife. They have two more children together now. There are two kids in her life, but I don't believe they're her biological children anyway, who she is also partially supporting. Those two kids don't live with them but apparently she/they pay for stuff for this child.\n\nEx and I started getting along better but then his marriage was rocky.

Then it was comments about our boys old clothes at my house being sent to his house for his other kids and how *we* needed to make sure they had adequate clothing. I told him there was no we in that and he said of course there is, we're co-parents. I said of our two sure, but not his other kids. It was requests for me to have his children in my home or to take them out to eat with me and our kids. And finally it has turned into back to school craziness. I bought supplies for the boys and he told me I hadn't bought nearly enough *for everyone*. I was like hold up, what's that supposed to mean and he pointed out that what I bought wouldn't be possible to share evenly between all five children. I told him we don't have five children, we have two, the two I bought those for. I told him I am responsible for our children not his three others. I told him he has a wife, they share two of those children, the other is in their home, so it's up to them. He told me that I know they don't have a lot of money and I cut him off and told him that still didn't make his children my problem. He said I can't possibly take care of just two of them, not when we're co-parenting and all five kids live together 50% of the time.

I just wanted to make sure I wasn't being unreasonable and get opinions before I try to have that convo. He's a great and considerate boyfriend normally, which is why this is a weird outlier that I wanted to figure out. I won't be replying anymore (unless there's a direct unanswered question) as I've received enough opinions to see the whole picture clearer.\n\nEdit 2: Convo had. It wasn’t going well at first cuz he was still upset at me for accusing him (fair enough) and still didn’t understand my reasoning for using specific kitchenware. Then I obviously apologised then explained myself by comparing it with some of his sensory dislikes (altho his are more touch and sound while mine’s a bit of everything) and he basically accepted it as “I can imagine that and if that’s somehow how you feel I’ll be more understanding next time” so yay. Pretty simple when all’s said and done.\n\nNever thought I’d need advice on such a trivial thing that shouldn’t be worthy of an argument but here goes. I (20F) am undiagnosed but likely am neurodivergent (it’s taboo where I’m from). I live with my boyfriend (21M) and we have an assortment of cutlery / kitchenware. I don’t particularly mind the spoons / knives as much altho would spend extra time picking out one that I’m content with. However, for forks, I have 2 specific types that I like, and for glasses, I also have 2 specific types. My boyfriend and I don’t argue that often, and when we do it’s about more serious topics. Yet we have had maybe 3-4 arguments over this.\n\nSpecifically, most of the time I get my own cutlery, but sometimes he would, and he doesn’t care which he picks, sometimes it’s the one I like, sometimes not. First time we argued, I had gotten up to switch to the one I like, but he stopped me and told me to just use the other one. I explained I genuinely have a better time eating when it’s my fork. He said I was being obsessive and stubborn and that I’ll have to learn to stop wasting time just because something is not how I like it. Fair, right? Except it’s a fork, if it makes me feel better.. why can’t I spend an extra 10 seconds of my own time? Also, it’s not like I must use my fork, I’m ok using another, but when my fork is available, I will go for it.\n\nThis basically same scenario happened again once or twice but with a glass or other. I decided this wasn’t worth arguments and sour moods so I started to get my own cutlery whenever I can and stop swapping forks and glasses whenever it does happen but still made it known I wanted my ones (rarely he’d make the swap for me). \n\nThe problem died down, until recently, 3 times in a row in a span of a few days, he got the glass I didn’t like even tho there were plenty of the glasses I liked available. I was already not in a great mood, so I made an observation, which I admit was an accusation that I regret I didn’t bring up another way: “You always give the glass I don’t like, it’s like you’re doing it on purpose”. I suppose it came out of nowhere for him but it’s been building up for me. He immediately got defensive and said I was just picking a fight and he just picked whatever was closest. He said I was stubborn about cutlery, I said sounds like he was stubborn about it too. We just ended it with silent treatment which is once again absolutely not worth it over forks. \n\nI just wanna feel good when I eat, it’s my comfort zone, I never study during it, but when I’m feeling forced to use uncomfortable kitchenware it just makes the entire thing sour. Plus, while I’m undiagnosed, he’s diagnosed (first world country privilege) altho only slightly. It feels unfair when he uses his diagnosis to excuse his actions, but I can’t say anything.\n\nI wrote this up quite quickly so I might’ve forgotten details. Please ask any clarifying questions. I also would appreciate advice on what kind of conversation is needed to be had.", "assistant": "NTA. You getting up to get the fork you're most comfortable eating with doesn't affect him a whit. If he knows which one you like, he can get it for you in the first place. Instead, he couldn't be bothered to take the extra seconds himself, then pitched a fit. It doesn't sound like you flat out refuse to eat unless it's the \"right\" fork. The number of people who insist on trying to control how (or what) other people eat is astounding."}

She said that although the lease requires us to do yard maintenance, she has lived there for over a year and the property management company doesn't actually require it. She also told me that the tenants I was taking over for would clean before they left. She had texted me and told me it was cleaned.\n\nWhen I moved in, I gained access to the property records and found out that the tenants I took over for were evicted (their off leash dog attacked the neighbors dog). When I confronted her about this she admitted to the lie, they had not bought a house and they were evicted.\n\nThe basement was also not cleaned, and I had to scrub grime off the walls from the dog so that it did not have a lingering smell. This did take care of the smell and after \\~10 hours of work things were in order (had to patch holes in dry wall, clean the bathroom and shelving as well).\n\nThen two weeks in, we got delivered a 3 days to Comply to Vacate notice where we had to restore the yard to the original condition. This took the whole weekend and \\~20 hours of labor from myself. She helped throughout the whole weekend. We avoided eviction and the property management company was happy.\n\nMy roommate and I each own a cat. Most recently, she left a lily plant in a Tupperware of water with fertilizer on the living room floor. Lilies, including the water they are in, are highly poisonous to cats. My cat drank from it and became ill. I had to take her to the vet, spend money on medication, and stay home from work to monitor her and clean shit off of her \\~3x a day (she had really bad diarrhea). My cat is since doing well.\n\nThis has all just really worn me down. The cat poisoning was especially distressing. I ended up losing it and yelling at her for being so incredibly irresponsible, telling her I was done with all of this, that meeting her was one of the worst things that has happened to me. I did not cuss or threaten her whatsoever. I was not yelling at the top of my lungs but I was certainly emotional.

It also meant she had minimal contact with her grandchildren when she favored him. \n\nMy father, who lost that home in a divorce, said it wasn’t fair that Jason inherited everything from my mom. My father suddenly passed away, and Jason was kept out of his will because my dad was still sour about what my mom did. \n\nJason was shocked when he was left out of my dad’s will. He said the property tax on my mom’s house was late because he was planning to use the money from Dad's inheritance, which was a dirty trick Dad pulled on him. \n\nMy sister Debbie already told Jason to get a fucking job, and maybe he will have the 7k by the time it’s due. I’m also not giving Jason shit. It’s how my dad wanted it. \n\nJason was freaking out during the reading because he didn’t get anything, and he’s already going through most of my mom’s money and hasn’t worked in 5 years since her death. \n\nHe called us all assholes and said he needed the money more than us. I’m sure this was the same line he used on my mom to get Debbie and me written out of my mom’s will.\n\nJason acts like he will fight the will, but my dad talked about how Jason got 100% of my mom’s inheritance; he doesn’t get anything.

My grandma said she is no longer going to leave Debbie and me anything now because of how we treated our brother, but I reminded my grandma that our mom (her daughter) started this, and no one threw a fit about it when mom died. Debbie had two small children then and could have used the money.

He responded as expected given our past of helping each other with nearly everything in class.\n\n“Yeah, of course!”\n\nHe asked if he could read mine first, and I let him. He said he thought it was great. I then asked to read his and he refused. I was looking forward to reading his so I could take some inspiration to improve my essay.

Since his mom died in 2020, he’s been in “reset mode.” He burnt through his inheritance, a house sale, and a lottery win. He won’t even toast a bagel or make a cup of coffee, high-end everything. \n\nHe burns bridges. He cohabited a house when the co-owner abandoned it, got a restraining order, and a legal remedy to divest from it.\n\nHe is living off credit cards. Last year, a friend gave him a job. He clashed with everyone, complained to his boss friend about everything, and from what he says, the ending was reality housewives TV worthy. \n\nIn 2021, a mutual friend offered me a job. Charles was incensed that she hadn’t offered him a job; then he looked up the job salary and told me I was entitled. He blocked her. When they were visiting our hometown holidays, he caused a public scene when she asked why he had blocked her. \n\nI’ve always tried to be supportive without being judgmental. Our conversations have gotten difficult. If I ask how his new profession is going, he snaps that not everyone gets offered a free job. If I share something I’m doing in retirement, the response is, “Must be nice. I can’t afford that. You live in a different reality.” It’s become harder to discuss anything without him becoming resentful.\n\nHe is now a TikToker; it’s all political Angertainment about the right.\n\nI’ve had some serious health issues the last five years (2 cancers, heart, liver, pancreas problems, UC). My prescriptions are $60k/yr before insurance. So when my COBRA ended and I had to switch to ACA, my premiums doubled.

You’ll have to sit at home and live off scraps and Netflix like us peasants.”\n\nI said, “Yeah, guess I’ll just have to give up my shopping and Amazon addiction and no Starbucks.”\n\nHe said I was an A-hole for talking about having to pay for insurance when he doesn’t have the money to pay for insurance. I was entitled, compared me to people he hates, said I don’t know what the real world is like, and told me to go F myself. He even threw in a homophobic slur and accused me of secretly being a Republican, to which I know I threw gas on and said maybe I am. He hung up, blocked me everywhere, and that was that.\n\nI’m not surprised based on history. I know he struggles, and I understand it must be hard to hear about someone else’s retirement when he feels left behind. But I was just being honest about my own fears, not bragging, not rubbing it in.

Maddie constantly instigates social dramas at her school and then cries wolf if people stand up to her. My parents are the main part of the problem. They feed into Maddie’s antics completely, and always push the narrative that it’s all somebody else’s fault.\n\n\n\nThe latest claim from Maddie was that a girl “Nora” was harassing her and calling her ugly/bullying her for body in the locker rooms. Obviously, my parents came to the school guns blazing and revving to get Nora expelled for what she did to precious Maddie.\n\n\n\nThe school was prepared for this meeting and had two other girls there who were both witnesses to the incident. My parents parroted Maddie’s story about Nora bullying and harassing her, and both the girls who were witnesses explained that wasn’t what happened.\n\n\n\nThe girls both said Maddie accused Nora of checking her out. Nora just said that she wasn’t checking Maddie out or attracted to Maddie at all and to leave her alone. Nora only spoke in self-defense of herself after Maddie went up to her first and didn’t say anything else to Maddie.\n\n\n\nIf I were our parents, would have apologized for what happened, made Maddie apologize, then grounded Maddie for being a liar and instigator in the first place. Nope.

On Sunday, my parents told me to text Uncle Daniel and ask why he’s not responding to them because he has the connections to help them sue the school.\n\n\n\nI got fed up and told my parents that Uncle Daniel’s probably ignoring them because this situation is just so stupid. I also said that instead of being overzealous and fighting with the school, they should tell precious Maddie to just mind her own business. I guarantee that most of her social dramas will go away if she does that.\n\n\n\nI got grounded and had my phone confiscated for being disrespectful. So now I’m writing this on a school computer. My parents said I was acting like a brat and a 16-year-old who’s never paid bills has no place to dictate what they do.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, that’s true to an extent.

So when my mom went MIA for a bit longer than usual I went looking for her and found her upset. She said nothing was wrong. But an hour later I heard my grandparents call her a bad mom and I stopped and admittedly I eavesdropped on what they were saying. They were saying mom should be ashamed for crying where I could see and how did my dad ever let her raise me with him when she abandoned me when I was a baby for weeks and didn't even care about me back then. They said mom was a lunatic and should be ashamed of herself for ruining my life.\n\nThe context to that is my mom had PPP (post-partum psychosis) after I was born. She got really sick and spent 11 weeks in a hospital/treatment center to help her because she was really at risk. My dad tried to get her help but a lot of people dismissed him. I was maybe 8 or 9 weeks old before someone took him seriously and helped him with mom and got her the help she needed. The experience left them both with trauma and it took mom a long time to recover fully. But when she had, they were afraid to risk more kids and so they decided they were one and done with me. I've always been aware of this.\n\nSo hearing my grandparents speak to mom like that was awful. Mom left them while I was still eavesdropping and she pulled me away and said it was okay. A while later a group of us were in the kitchen eating and my grandparents were making comments about how lucky some people were to have lots of grandkids and how much it helps when each kid has more than one. My dad was like wtf at them. That's when I brought up how shitty they were to make more digs at more. I called them out on it. I said it was disgusting and mom didn't deserve the shit they said. My grandparents told me that I didn't understand and I know they love me. I said they sure didn't talk like that. I said calling my mom a lunatic and rubbing it in her face that she only had me and no more with dad, when they know she was sick after me, made it seem like they I wasn't enough for them. I also said it was shitty to shame a woman who made the safest choice for her family. My dad was furious with his parents and asked what the hell was going on. They slipped up and basically confessed that they'd been saying shit to mom since I was a baby and always went behind everyone's backs so we wouldn't know.\n\nThey tried to lecture me about calling them out but dad shut it down and asked me and mom to wait in the car. Apparently some of the extended family are anti-me now for calling out my grandparents in front of others and my grandparents are also saying how disrespectful I am. Dad raged at anyone who blamed me. But I do wonder if I should have handled it more privately? Like telling dad instead of calling them out like that.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA.

I started dating my boyfriend around the same time, and she began telling me how unhappy her relationship was making her. I comforted her and gave advice, and when things got worse, I told her maybe she should consider ending it. She refused, and I understood, it’s hard when you love someone. But when he wanted to break up and she begged him to stay, I got upset and told her it would only make things worse. Eventually, he ended it anyway. She accepted it, but told everyone she was the one who broke up with him, which I supported as her friend.\n\nSince then, she’s been upset and looking for happiness in the wrong places. Just weeks after the breakup, she got on several dating apps which seemed normal, and I even talked with her about her matches. But soon she started being rude to the guys: leading them on, insulting them, and leaving them on read. I’m not the type to think men deserve special treatment, but these were genuine guys looking for something real, and it felt wrong and unfair. When I asked her why, she admitted she just wanted people to talk to. I knew she was hurting, so I let it go.\n\nThen she started hanging out with people she used to call “bad” and acting differently. She loves nightlife while I’m the opposite, so she kept begging me to go to bars and clubs. I refused, I’m not comfortable in that scene and even when she tried guilt-tripping me, I stood firm. After a serious talk, she stopped pressuring me (though she still brings it up sometimes). Instead, she began going out with those other friends, getting drunk, making out with random guys, and letting them drive her home drunk. When we hang out, she brags about leading men on like it’s funny, and I’m sick of it.\n\nNow this summer I’ve been overwhelmed: dealing with family issues, long work hours, college clubs, interviews, saving money for school, and ongoing health problems. Because of all this, I only see her about once every two weeks. My boyfriend lives far away, so weekends are the only time I can spend with him, and I try to prioritize that. A couple weeks ago she asked to hang out, but I wasn’t sure when I’d be free. I had a doctor’s appointment on my day off, so I told her I couldn’t that week. Later, I switched a shift to spend a Sunday with my boyfriend before he left again. When she found out, she got upset, saying I knew she wanted to see me before she started a full time office job but made other plans. But she also knows weekends are the only chance I get with him.\n\nThe truth is, I haven’t been doing well mentally, and with everything going on, I just don’t have the energy to keep dealing with her drama. Hanging out feels draining when it’s always the same “funny” or “ugly” guys she’s leading on. I don’t want to be a bad friend, but I also can’t ignore how I feel or sacrifice my priorities just to keep her happy.", "assistant": "NTA she can't expect you to be her friend if she won't be your friend too, which includes being understanding that you have a lot on your plate right now. Maybe next time she goes at you for not being available just say that you haven't unloaded on her much because of what she's going thru but you're struggling a lot right now and you trust that she will respect that you aren't as available these days. \n\n\nAlso, being supportive to her doesn't mean you have to lie and give the opinion/reaction she wants instead of what you really believe - when you do talk to her and she tells a story about being mean to a guy, don't laugh or agree, instead say something like how mad you'd be if someone treated her like that. Maybe even broach the subject that she appears to be punishing random men instead of processing her feelings about her ex and maybe she should speak to a professional."}

Like many adult children, I have grown to be compassionate to the ways I wish she and my dad had done a better job. I feel like I carry that well. But recently I asked my mom to stop blowing up my phone at all hours of the day between phone calls and nostalgic photos. A little necessary context: my parents had us very young (mom was 17 when my brother was born, then had me and my sister a couple years later). My dad was the bread winner, she stayed home with us our entire childhood. Motherhood is all she has known. Cut to now, I am 27, my siblings are both well-established adults living on their own raising families. Each of us work and have lives that keep us busy, but we still do a good job of spending time with our parents. My dad still works as he owns a small business, my mom still stays home. \n\nTo put it plainly, she has no friends, no hobbies, nothing outside of the four walls of their house. I feel very sad for her in a lot of ways, but I also feel tired of shouldering the weight of her loneliness. At any point during the day, you will find her obsessively scrolling through her photos and videos and watching the same few over and over again. She's been doing this since I can remember; before we had smartphones, she always had photo albums pulled out. She constantly sends photos, old FB posts, and if she does not get an immediate response praising her discovery, she calls several times. \n\nWhen I was in college, I very clearly and gently said it might be a good  idea to get some new hobbies, join a church, find a part-time job. I just want her to get her own life that doesn't revolve around us. She hated that suggestion and scolded me about how lucky I am to have a mom so involved in my life. My friends (from childhood to college to now at 27) call her a helicopter parent if that sheds any light to the degree of her involvement. \n\nYesterday, during an exceptionally busy work day, she sent nearly 20 photos spanning from childhood sports to youth group events to our childhood dog to the birth of my nephew. She called three times, once before sending, twice after sending. I finally texted back explaining that I was working and would try to call back later. She replied with \"sorry for bothering you,\" but because I know her, I knew it was a pitiful woe is me response. Later, I told her to please stop blowing up my phone, to please stop fixating on old memories, and to find new activities outside of her kids to fill her time. She was extremely upset, telling me I am not a mother so I cannot possibly understand her type of love and all. She is just exhausting. I love her so much, but I am so tired of feeling guilty about how her only life experience has been that of motherhood so I should just accept it. Am I the asshole?", "assistant": "NTA.

(throwaway account)\n\nI (15F) used to be really close with my cousin, C (17F), who had her daughter, P, last year. Since we’re close in age, I’ve always supported her, especially during her pregnancy and unstable relationship with P’s dad. I’ve spent time with P a lot—taking her to the park or the gallery—and when C asked me to babysit one evening while she went out with friends, I agreed because I love both of them.\n\nEverything went fine until 11:30, the time C said she’d be back. She didn’t show up, didn’t call, and didn’t answer my texts. Since P was asleep, I decided to wait, assuming she lost track of time. But hours passed with no word from C, which wasn’t like her, so I got really worried. I tried contacting her friends and checking her location, but she’d turned it off. This was odd since she’d always shared her location with me.\n\nFinally, she texted around 3:00 AM saying she was staying over at a friend’s because it was late, and she didn’t want to pay for a taxi. By this point, I was exhausted and upset—C had left me in the dark and essentially made me watch P all night without asking. If she had communicated her plans, I might’ve agreed, but it felt unfair to assume I’d stay, especially since I’m only 15.\n\nAt first, I decided to wait it out until morning and talk to C later, but P woke up screaming, and I couldn’t get her back to sleep. Feeling overwhelmed, I called P’s dad (C’s ex) for help. After explaining the situation, he came over with his mom to pick up P. I texted C to let her know where P was and stayed on her sofa for the night, planning to leave in the morning.\n\nWhen I woke up, I had no response from C, so I went home and told my parents, who supported my decision. Later, C called me, furious, accusing me of betrayal and saying I’d “sided” with her ex. She also claimed I had dragged P into her issues with him. Despite trying to explain my perspective, she hung up. A few days later, she sent a long message reiterating how hurt she felt and blaming me for breaking her trust.\n\nSince then, I’ve been bombarded with messages from C’s friends and even my aunt, saying I shouldn’t have called her ex and should’ve just stayed the night. But I’m confused because P regularly sees her dad, has stayed at his house before, and I never agreed to watch her overnight.\n\nWas I wrong to call P’s dad and not wait it out? Or was I right to do what I did?\n\nEDIT: Since a few people have asked and I forgot to mention, my aunt and uncle (C’s parents) had gone away for the weekend which was why C went out in the first place, and I didn’t call my parents because I honestly just panicked and thought it was too late at night\n\nUPDATE: I wasn’t sure if I should put this in a comment or if I should edit the post, so please tell me if I did it wrong so I can fix it!!\n\nThanks so much for all your responses, it’s really reassuring to hear all your opinions so thank you so much!! I don’t think I did a great job at explaining the situation fully when I wrote my original post, I was pretty upset about all the messages so I think it came off a little bit like a huge rant, so I’ll explain a few things I saw people asking questions about.\n\n-The original plan for me to watch P was that once C came home at 11.30 I would go to sleep at their house, and she would take over, but since she didn’t I obviously wasn’t going to go to sleep with P in the house whilst I didn’t know where my cousin was.\n-I’m also really close with C anyway, and I sleep over a lot so it’s pretty usual for me to be sleeping there which is why my parents didn’t reach out during the whole thing (I’m realising now that I should’ve called them but its too late now). I think this is also why she expected me to just stay and deal with the whole thing.\n-I see a lot of people talking about how my first reaction should’ve been to call my parents and not P’s dad, and you’re probably right but thats just not what I did. My relationship with my parents isn’t great so they usually aren’t my first choice in an emergency call, and I knew P’s dad pretty well from when he would be at my cousin’s house a lot so I thought that as her dad I should call him first. \n\nTo start to like, resolve what’s happened and take some of the advice given, I talked to my mum this morning and showed her the texts from my aunt and my cousin’s friends, I’ve blocked the friends and my mum says she’s going to go round and talk to my aunt later today so hopefully that will be sorted!!\nI also got some texts from P’s dad earlier, thanking me for calling him which definitely made me feel better about this, and a few of you were right, him and his mum apparently want to argue for more custody of P so that’s probably what all the anger from C is about.\n\nI sent C a message explaining that I understand that she might have issues with P’s dad, but that in that situation where I really was out of my depth and dealing with things that were too much for me, he was the best person to call since he is the other parent and she never told me not to call him. I’ve not heard anything back yet but I know she’s pretty mad at me so I don’t expect anything from her soon. Thanks again for all the reassurance!! I definitely won’t be babysitting for her again and to the people that are saying I’m lying about ages idk why I’d lie?? Don’t know what I’d gain from that tbh. I’ll continue to update if anything else happens though.", "assistant": "NTA\n\nYour cousin was taking advantage of you.  No responsible mother would fail to answer her phone when her baby is being watched by someone.  If there had been a medical emergency, that would have been too much pressure on you.  I am thinking your cousin didn’t tell you that she was planning on staying out all night because she thought you might have refused to watch her child.  Her behavior was totally irresponsible.  You tried to get ahold of her and when she didn’t answer, you called the baby’s father.  She is acting like you just went home, leaving the baby alone in the house with the front door wide open.  You did the responsible thing.  Don’t let their comments upset you.  She is just feeling guilty and probably embarrassed for setting you up for an overnight babysitting without warning you."}

We've hinted at - hell, even flat out said in some comments - that we were playing with the rules a bit. Well, that's done now, and they have been rolled out!\n\nOverall, most things are still in place. We really streamlined the rules. And maybe more importantly for simplicity, that monster of an FAQ we had! But the rules still contain most of the same stuff. Just simplified. \n\nFor example, rules 12, 13 and 14 each dealt with a specific topic that wasn't allowed. We combined those in to one rule - Rule 5, Banned Topics. Rule 5 now covers debate topics, revenge stories, and medical issues. But we've also taken the opportunity to include some officially retired topics that won't be allowed in this sub from here on. Hold your applause! Weddings are NOT banned. BUT...here's what we will no longer host:\n\n- Posts about inhertiance issues.\n- Posts about seating on public transportation. Yes, that includes you not giving your first class seat to the single mother with 8 children who thinks you're selfish and entitled.\n- Relationship posts are still not permitted, but covered under their own rule (formerly rule 11, now rule 8).\n- *Anything* dealing with violence is also still covered under a separate rule (formerly rule 5, now rule 3).\n\nWhile we've been working behind the scenes on this for some time, we aren't calling this fully closed out. Just as in the past, we'll revisit something if there's a need.\n\nOne more quick note about another change, that just came up recently but we thought it was a great suggestion. u/slonkycat sent us a [Modmail message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=) with a new flair suggestion that we felt was too good to not take. So we now have, nestled between Sultan of Sphincter and His Holiness the Poop, Assholier Than Thou! Thank you for the suggestion, slonky!\n\n---\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

This already makes me feel very awkward but now she has asked if I can stop wearing makeup and wear baggy clothes around him.\n\nWe went out for dinner last night at a reasonably expensive restaurant with a few others (7 of us in total) and she text me when I got home saying she was angry at me for ‘looking hot’ after she asked me to not wear makeup. She’s my friend and I want to do the right thing but there’s nothing I could wear that is baggy that would have suited the restaurant we were in (Michelin star). My style is very conservative and I was wearing a very average dress with heels.\n\nI’ve written out several responses ranging from an apology to being quite rude but wanted to sense check my thoughts here before I go back to her.

He is now blocked. \n\nFINAL UPDATE - Edit 3: I responded with the following: “Sorry it’s taken me a while to reply but I wanted to consider this properly and not react emotively. I’m sorry you feel that way but I don’t think it’s fair or reasonable to ask me to change how I look because of your husband. My advice is to speak to (husband’s name) and work on your relationship because projecting your issues onto me isn’t going to help you, but it will damage our friendship.

Also, WTF?! I can’t believe so many people care or have an opinion about my boring issue. X", "assistant": "NTA. If she thinks it’s okay to ask a friend to wear baggy clothing to dinner out with a group, she should feel more than comfortable telling her husband not to look.

Even telling you about this was gross, asking you to manage it for her, at your own expence, is worse. \n\nIn fact, how about she leave her man at home, since apparently he can’t stop himself from being creepy about her friends.

She was promptly asked to leave but not before calling me every name in the book and accusing me of hating animals (mind you my own dog was in my car with the AC on while I ate for a quick 10 mins). \n\nI told a few friends what happened, and they are mixed on whether I should have just switched tables vs causing a scene.

My brother is also mentally challenged and my sister has two jobs and depression. Therefore all the cleaning tends to fall on me; especially when I wanna have people other. My friend came over with little-to-no notice because she was having issues at home. I was shocked when she came to my house so soon and I told her that it was messy because I hadn’t had a chance to clean. I warned her that my house was messy and she was joking around with me about how it was in fact messy because that’s just how we are. After a couple hours we go downstairs and I bake her a pizza because she wanted to eat some food. She saw my messy stove and proceeded to show it to someone we were on the phone with. I immediately asked her why she would do that and told her to stop. Afterwards we went upstairs to eat and that’s was the end of it.

My sister came to stay with me during my recovery as I was going to have a hard time getting around for the first few days.\n\nAt the same time, a family friend (Alice) came to my city for a bridal shower. We’ve known each other for 20 or so years, and I’d been living in this city for seven years at that point. When she first mentioned her trip months in advance, I said we could try to meet up, but I really underestimated how rough the surgery would be on me. I am young and thought I would bounce back super quick, and while I healed well, it still kicked my butt for the first week.\n\nBy the time she got here, I was three days post-op, exhausted, on pain meds, and even getting up to go to the bathroom was a challenge, and the old man noises I would make were less than auditorially pleasing. Alice invited me to a friend’s birthday dinner (I'm not sure how many people were in the group, but it was at least five). I’m pretty reserved normally, and I didn’t know the birthday person. The restaurant they were going to is pretty touristy (nothing wrong with that, but overpriced), I had never met the birthday person, and according to friends who have been to this place, it’s very loud and the seating would not have been very fitting for a person three days post-op. Maybe it’s the introvert in me, but that just didn't sound very good time and I know I would’ve been bad company, so I declined. \n\nThe next day, Alice wanted to swing by my place before leaving (she was only in town for maybe two days, three almost). It’s important to note that she didn’t have a vehicle. I live in a small apartment that can barely host two people; her group of girlfriends would probably be waiting outside, and she’s allergic to my pets. At this point, I was just tired and wanted to rest, so I suggested we wait until her next trip or until I go back to my hometown to visit. \n\nI thought that was the end of that, but turns out Alice was upset. She never directly said anything to me, but about a week or so later, some mutual acquaintances (who live in our hometown) ended up unfriending/blocking me on social media and blowing off my sister when she tried to hang out. \n\nI do feel bad for not seeing Alice, and I understand it probably came across as me blowing her off. But at the same time, I was three days post-op and barely managing basic things. Some of those mutual acquaintances I mentioned earlier who blocked me? At some point, they had been in my city and never mentioned it to me, but I didn’t get offended and unfriend/block people. While it sucked, I understand that they have their own lives, sometimes things just don’t work out how we want them too.\n\nAITA for not making more of an effort to see her?", "assistant": "NAH.\n\nYou're telling US why you didn't spend more time with Alice.

Plus I can't drink and I don't want to split my stitches.\"*\n\nAs for her \"dropping by\", personally I would have let her.  It's not YOUR problem if there's no room for her friends.  SHE can decide whether to stay or go or have them wait in the car.   AGAIN, I would be 100% honest and say *\"I'm just out of surgery so I haven't had the energy to vacuum up the cat hair, but come on up!\"*\n\nSometimes people think they need to complete a social contract.  She was in your city and wanted to make an effort to connect.  Even 5 minutes in the apartment might have been enough for her to check the box.

My stepdaughter is 9, I have known her since she was 2 and I became her stepmom when she was 4. We also have a 3 year old son and a 10 month old daughter together. To give some background info first:\n\nMy stepdaughter's mom was not in the picture when I met my husband. She never wanted to claim any parental responsibilities and when I met my husband, his ex had accumulated a lot of child support debt and had not seen my stepdaughter since the hospital. I signed up for being a second parent and I love my stepdaughter and in my heart I consider her one of my kids just as much as my bio children. We had such a good relationship. She would sometimes call me mom, sometimes my name, but she'd always say my husband and I were her parents and she adored her brother when he was born.\n\nOver two years ago her mom came back into the picture and said she wanted to see my stepdaughter. My husband said it would need to be a gradual thing but my stepdaughter had a right to know her. His ex didn't like that and sued for full custody, and yes, after having nothing to do with her for 7 years. She lost but this started us on a step up plan for her to gain some custody. It's been hell.\n\nMy relationship with my stepdaughter suffered badly because of all this. Her relationship with her siblings has also suffered. She is rude to me now, refuses to listen to me and rejects the three of us. It's always worse after she sees her mom. My husband took this issue to court and the judge made it clear he will never sever the relationship between mom and daughter, no matter what.\n\nI'm struggling. If I give her the time and attention needed, it comes at the cost to our younger kids. But if I focus just on them, it's not giving her the time and attention she needs and the counselor told us she needs to see I'm not going anywhere. She really emphasized that it was important.\n\nThe counselor even spoke to the judge (a different one this time) and the judge said he was going to follow the previous judges decision that contact is never to be severed between mother and daughter. My husband brought this issue back to court because it was getting worse.\n\nSo now we're at a point where I can't be in charge of all three at the same time all day, especially now school is out but even during school time it's too much. I told my husband we need to hire some sort of helper for me with the kids. He was against it and told me it was a big expense after we spent a fortune on court and therapy. His parents heard us talking about it the other day and they jumped in to say I wouldn't do this if all three were my bio kids and I just want to pawn my stepdaughter off on someone else. I insisted this was not true to all three and I insisted I needed help because the kids will suffer in the long run and so will my mental health.\n\nMy husband felt guilty because I got very emotional but his parents said I just proved I wouldn't do this if they were all really mine.\n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA\n\nIt's clearly apparent that the ex is poisoning the child against you and both of those judges are failing all of you, but her especially.\n\nObviously the ex is committing stepfamily alienation, and since the ex hasn't escalated to full parental alienation, it's incumbent upon your husband to set rules and boundaries for the child to counteract what his ex is doing to her.\n\nAlso, next time the In Laws say that you wouldn't be doing this if she was your bio kid, tell them that they're absolutely right. Because if she was your kid she'd live 100% of the time at your home and a virtual stranger wouldn't be sabotaging the relationship."}

Once there, we planned a road trip with her, her family and a family friend of theirs.\n\nDue to the number of passengers, it was agreed we would use both of my sister's cars since my family and their family friend flew in. Prior to using the car, we did get it checked by a mechanic to make sure it was in a good condition for a road trip and they said it was in a fine to use. \n\nAt the end of the road trip, while I was driving, the car breaks down in the middle of the road. We had to get it towed. \n\nNow my sister is demanding I pay for the whole car. I argued that since all 3 of us benifited, it should be split 3 ways. I also argued that since it was an older car, I shouldn't have to pay it at the cost they bought it for. \n\nSo am I the asshole?

Consider it this way: if you had rented a car and it broke down, the car rental company would have got you a replacement, not charged you for repairing a mechanical failure - not even a portion of the cost. It is the car company’s responsibility to maintain their vehicles. (Now, if you had been off-roading or something similar that caused the mechanical failure, that would be different.)\n\nYou need to understand exactly what failed and what caused it before deciding whether you should give your sister any money.\n\nIf the damage was due to something from the road trip (e.g., a road hazard created a leak in the coolant tank), the three families should split the cost of the repair. If, say, the alternator died of old age, that’s really your sister’s responsibility, but it would be a nice gesture if the three families split the cost of that repair.\n\nIf the car is a total loss because of this mechanical failure (not directly due to some decision on your part) then that is fully on your sister.\n\nETA: Just read a reply of yours. You ASKED your sister what to do when the car started shaking. She/her spouse TOLD you to keep driving. This was their decision and their responsibility.

I was with my ex “Venus” for over 10 years, from when I was 15 until I was almost 26. I am currently 31. Venus was raised a vegan and has never (to my knowledge) eaten meat or any animal product. While we were together, we had 3 boys, M11 “Mercury,” M9 “Jupiter,” and M7 “Mars.”\n\nWhen I first got into the relationship with Venus, I started to follow the vegan diet because she wanted me to, and I’ve mostly followed it even after we broke up, mainly out of habit. During this time, I had to be very careful with what I ate to ensure I got the proper nutrients, and my food bill every month was sky-high. I also had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. About 3 months ago, I slowly started to reintroduce meat into my diet, and since then, I’ve felt so much better. I haven’t had to buy loads of vitamins or carefully plan my diet to ensure I got every amino acid or avoided deficiencies, and my food bill dropped.\n\nI also started doing research into kids who are raised vegan and found some things that made me nervous. I read that vegan kids can sometimes be shorter and might need supplements for things like B12, calcium, and iron if they aren’t getting everything they need from their diet. None of my boys have started puberty yet, which might be okay, but since I hit puberty at around 9, it got me worried about Mercury. They’re also all in about the 5th-15th percentile for height and weight, which made me want to check in with the doctor, which also made me very concerned after I learnt that their vegan diet could have impacted this. I was never a short kid, but idk I think I just assumed they were just short for their age.\n\nWhen I brought my concerns to our GP, he recommended introducing meat and animal products into their diets first to see if it would help with growth before considering other options.\n\nSo, following that advice, 6 weeks ago I decided to slowly introduce animal products into their diets whenever they had their time with me, but it has been slow. I don't want to introduce it too fast and I gave them the choice with all the information I had and with what the doctor said. I informed Venus about this and she was furious with me, saying how I’m just doing it to be vindictive to her, when I’m not. And that if I don’t stop she is going to go back to family court and get the Child Arrangements Order changed so she has full custody of the boys and I only get visitation. \n\nI told her that this was recommended by their GP and she said I had ‘no right in going to the GP without her’, when that is not true, it was during my time with them I am entitled to do whatever I want. \n\nShe’s calling me cruel and she’s been telling our boys that they should refuse to eat any animal products and to say I’m forcing them. When this isn’t true and every time they’ve been over they’ve loved trying new foods like real milk, eggs, etc. some they don’t like which is fair. \n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA.

I'm really proud of him, I couldn't wish for a better son. \nAnyway, Lucas has been visiting my sister (28F) for 3 days. My sister has a son (8M) Gabriel. I was hoping Lucas would be friends with him. I exchanged messages with Lucas and he always said it's going okay. \n\nYesterday, I went to my sister's house to pick up Lucas and she looked really hurt. Lucas was sitting there glum as well. I asked what was wrong and my sister told me to ask my son that question. \nIt took me a long time to convince Lucas to tell me the truth, and he finally admitted what was wrong. \n\nAs I understand it, Gabriel was curious about what Lucas was drawing (he had his sketchbooks with him). Lucas let him see his sketchbooks, but told him that Gabriel should handle them carefully. \n\nBut when Lucas was outside, Gabriel (with his mother's permission, as I understand it, and I'm not excusing her for this) decided to check Lucas's things.

But I promised him that I would buy him new sketchbooks and he could redraw his drawings in them. \n\nBut my husband thinks I acted like an asshole in this situation and Gabriel and my sister are wrong. \n\n**EDIT** Okay, I realized I was being an ahole because I didn't even ask if Gabriel apologized to my son.

Recently, we got a note that was a bit snippy saying they were \"surprised\" we'd park the cars on the street again \"after what happened last time\".\n\nSo...AITA for parking out the front of my own house?\n\nEDIT: For clarity - the purpose of the note was to tell me that they'd had to tell two groups of teens to rack off when they saw them sniffing around my car.  They just added the line about being surprised, as well as the information about sketchy people.  But yes, we should definitely get cameras.  By \"vandalised\", I mean the car has been egged in the past, and someone threw a beer bottle at it", "assistant": "NTA. And, ew, the note you got sounds like a veiled threat."}

We met right after college and have been very serious except we don’t live together. I wanted to move in together after year but she didn’t want to because her landlady/roommate gives her a good deal on rent. Her roommate’s family is rich and bought her an apartment because she has a lot of serious food allergies. She had roommates before but some would forget and bring home the allergens so she lived alone for a while. My gf always remembers not to and she is also a nurse which makes the roommates parents like her as she knows how to use an epi pen and respond to emergencies. She pays $700 all inclusive on rent for a 2 bed 2 bath whereas a studio in their area is like $1800 not including utilities. So I feel like the relationship is not going anywhere because she doesn’t want to leave the cheap rent but she could afford to pay more for rent but won’t as long as her roommate doesn’t kick her out. \n\nA few months ago her roommate was laid off and was talking about moving cities if she couldn’t find another job in this one. My gf and I began talking about moving in together as she would also need to leave in this case. We found the right place after looking for a while but she refused to sign as her roommate found another job. I was pissed because we had spent a lot of time looking at apartments and now she won’t sign. The place would have been $2100 plus utilities which means she would need to pay $1200-1300 a month which isn’t that bad given her salary. It’s more than what she is paying with her roommate but I don’t know I just feel like if she cared about our relationship she would pay it as we agreed we can’t process without living together. \n\nShe also recently paid off all her student loans from saving money from paying low rent and is now indulging herself. I have bought up moving in or maybe getting engaged and buying property together but she says she has worked hard her whole life and now that her student loans are gone she deserves some nice stuff. She has bought a lot of clothes and recently bought AirPods. She was showing them to me and I just said under my breath that she was choosing fancy headphones over us. She got mad and told me I was being ridiculous and that if I could pay what she does for her rent I would never want to leave either. I told her if would because I care about the relationship and I’m not selfish enough to choose clothes or AirPods over moving in. She left my apartment and hasn’t talked to me all weekend.", "assistant": "YTA. Come on. She finally has a bit of breathing room and she’s selfish because she doesn’t want to double her expenses right now.

He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side.\n\nThis has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food.\n\nThis came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified.\n\nOn the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them.\n\nHe got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this.\n\nSo, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.", "assistant": "NAH. But y'all are incompatible.

I've always wanted a cat but parents were always really against it. The biggest excuse they gave me was that I wasn't financially capable of taking care of a pet and honestly, fair enough.\n\nI'm a lawyer and for the last 1.5 years, my practice grew enough that I can comfortable support myself and take care of a pet. So a year ago I broght up the topic again.\n\nI told my sister first because she was always supportive and I wanted to get that easy yes first. She, like before, has said that she is fine with it as long as she doesn't have to take care of it but she said she doesn't think me having money will be enough to convince our parents.\n\nI brought it up to dad next and while dismissive at first, he said he doesn't want to get in the way of my dream so if I can convince mom, he'd also be fine with it. This was huge for me because I always considered dad as the biggest hurdle. So I proceeded to use every trick in the book to convice mom. It took a while but she finally said yes. Well, she said \"do whatever you want\". But it wasn't a no, so...\n\nI was super excited, I ran to my sister and said our parents were on board. She was shocked. Not happy shocked, like I told her someone died shocked. She was silent for a while and eventually said \"Well I don't want a cat in the house\".\n\nI didn't take it seriously at first, I really thought she was kidding. But she was serious. I asked her why and she said she didn't want to clean litter or puke. I told her I don't expect her to do any of that, I've told her this multiple times before so it didn't really make sense to bring it up now.\n\nAfter I pressed her further, she told me she's said yes all those years because she was sure our parents would never say yes. So basically, she let our parents be the bad guys while she looked supportive. But when our parents said yes, she realised there will actually be a cat in the house and she was absolutely not okay with it and she will never be okay with it.\n\nI was pissed to say the least, I told her, I'm getting the cat anyway and she started crying and said she lives in this house too so she should also have a say. I said normally that would be a fair argument and if she was honest from the beginning, I would try to find a compromise but since she lied about this for so long, her opinion no longer mattered.\n\nI ended up getting a cat from our local shelter. Mom and I fell in love with her from the first day and I can honestly say my sister loves her too but she literally tells everyone who will listen that she was against it but I just said her opinion didn't matter. Recently she brought it up with some mutual friends and even when I gave the full context, the majority have said that while she shouldn't have lied, I was TA for ignoring her feelings.

We are a very close family and we tend to do a lot together. Caleb got married last year to Ashley (F25). We really like her. We are as close to her as she lets us get. By that I mean, that we treat her like family and invite her to everything, but she usually only decides to join us every third time or so. She is an only child and close with her parents, so we accommodate holidays around her schedule.\n\nBefore Caleb and Ashley got married, her MOH threw her a bridal shower. They chose the same weekend as our family reunion. Kate and I skipped the family reunion to go to the shower, but the rest of the family did not.  Since our family missed the shower, I decided to throw her another, surprise shower and invited all our family that missed the shower, her mom and the bridal party. I chose a tea party theme. The shower went well, I thought, but as people were leaving, I overheard Ashley thanking her friends for being good sports about the lame tea party. She never complained to me directly, but it did hurt my feelings.\n\nLast month, my daughters and I went to get pedicures, and invited Ashley, but she declined. We were talking about the Bridgerton release coming up and planned a watch party. We're having an afternoon tea. Madison asked if Ashley was coming, but I said no because Ashley doesn't like Bridgerton or tea parties - the last watch party we had for Queen Charlotte, we invited her and she left after about an hour and a half through the show. She said she just couldn't get into it. \n\nDuring this, DH is going out to a poker night and he invited Caleb. When Caleb asked Ashley about it, he found out we hadn't invited her to watch with us. He called me up and yelled at me. I told him that I didn't invite her because she doesn't like tea parties and that she doesn't like Bridgerton. He said that didn't matter, I should have invited her anyway. I called Ashley, apologized to her, and told her that we didn't invite her because she doesn't like the show, and she just responded, \"you're right, I don't.\" So I just changed the subject and asked if we were doing Mother's Day the same schedule as usual. She said yes. But then, because I still hadn't invited her, Caleb called and said they weren't coming to mother's day at all and that I was being a jerk for excluding her.\n\nHere's where I MBTAH. I don't want her to come and that's why I'm not inviting her. She was distracting when we watched Queen Charlotte, making comments about things she didn't like about the show, and giving us dirty looks when we were goofing around in British accents. She declined any tea, and just fidgeted until she left. I don't want to have to worry if she thinks it's lame or that we're being silly, or if she is enjoying herself.

We had originally planned to stay in a hotel, but my brother suggested that the five of us rent an AirBnB.\n\nWe found a suitable rental which was located in the same neighbourhood as my uncle (whose son was getting married), which would allow us to travel to their house regularly. My parents were staying there, and we had other family members staying in hotels or AirBnBs in the same area. Typically at weddings, overseas guests in my mum’s family would congregate at the “wedding house” as a base every day to hang out, organise day trips, help with wedding prep.\n\nMy brother said the he was also planning on renting a car, and asked if we wanted to chip in. I said that if we did, we would expect to have equal use of the car. My brother thought about it, and then said he would need access to the car for the entire holiday, so he would just pay for it himself.\n\nNow, on the holiday itself, it ended up being the case that we got a lot of lifts from my brother. We didn’t insist on it, or even ask, but we didn’t turn the offer down either. It wouldn’t have made much sense for us to get an Uber to my uncle’s house when my brother was driving the car there (we were staying about 5 mins’ drive away, or a 30 minute walk).

It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. \n\nAnyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn’t have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family.

My siblings don’t have children, and my parents are retired. Recently, my sister moved into a new house and decided she’s hosting family gatherings with a new rule: no kids allowed.\n\nShe claims her house isn’t “kid-proof” and wants more “relaxed” events. She framed it like she’s doing everyone a favor, but let’s be honest—it’s just my kids, so this rule is clearly aimed at me. It’s hurtful because these are family dinners and holiday get-togethers we’ve always celebrated together as a family. Now suddenly, my kids aren’t welcome?\n\nWhat bothers me most is how this will affect my children. My 6-year-old adores his extended family, and if he finds out he’s being excluded, it would break his heart. I’m worried he’ll never get over it. How do I explain to him that he’s not wanted at these family events? It could create a rift between him and the rest of the family. He’s sensitive, and I don’t want him growing up thinking he’s not important.\n\nWhen she told me about her “no kids” rule, I said I wouldn’t attend if my kids weren’t invited. She accused me of overreacting, but if this becomes the norm, what happens for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas? Am I supposed to leave my kids at home every time?\n\nThe rest of my family is siding with her, telling me to just “go along with it” and leave the kids at home for a few hours. My parents, who don’t have grandkids from my siblings yet, think it’s no big deal. They’re even pressuring me to cut my sister some slack since she had a tough time buying her house. But where’s the consideration for me and my kids?\n\nTo top it off, my other sibling, who’s childfree, said, “Maybe this is good for you—you could probably use a break.” Great advice from someone who’s never had to juggle parenting while trying to stay connected to family.\n\nAITA for refusing to attend her gatherings and calling her out? I feel like I’m being forced to choose between being part of my family or being a parent.", "assistant": "INFO: Alright, we need to dig a little deeper here. The fact that your entire family is backing your sister’s no-kids rule has me wondering—are your kids a handful? Are we talking Bart Simpson-level pranks, Eric Cartman-level sass, or something else entirely?\n\nDo you have a close friend who can be blunt with you about this? Someone who can give you the real, unfiltered truth? Because if your kids are the rowdy ones or, heaven forbid, the smelly ones, that could explain why your sister felt the need to implement a “no kids” policy, and why everyone else is okay with it.\n\nLook, it’s one thing for kids to be a little hyper or restless at a family gathering, but if your sister went so far as to make a house rule, there might be more to this story. It’s possible she didn’t want to hurt your feelings by saying it outright, so she went with a blanket ban. Before jumping to conclusions, maybe have an honest chat to see if there’s something your family hasn’t told you. That way, you’re not left in the dark, and your kids aren’t being excluded for reasons that could be addressed."}

Part of me really wanted to do this, but I was reluctant because if I had binge eating episodes she'd almost certainly notice, and I'm so embarassed about it. Like the amount of food I can get through in a binge is insane. Then I'll usually restrict after a binge (yes I know that just causes another one...).\n\nI couldn't tell her the actual reason I was reluctant to move in with her, so it caused tension. I said something vague about not being sure if I'd be a good flatmate which she said was bs because we've known each other for years, so she thought I must have an issue with her I wasn't telling her. \n\nSince we moved in together my eating habits have improved- we cook dinner together, and I don't often feel like shutting myself in my room and binging. But this isn't an issue that goes away overnight, so if I binge I've started chewing food up and spitting it in a bag. I know this is still bad, but it doesn't feel as bad as before as I don't feel like I have to restrict afterwards, so I can still eat normally with my flatmate. I also get satisfied faster. I hide the bag in my room, then add it to the food waste when I take the rubbish out. \n\nLast week I came home drunk after a night out, and for some reason decided to take the bins out. I took the chewed bags from my room to add, but drunk me then forgot and left them on the table.\n\nMy flatmate found them in the morning and was disgusted. I tried to say it was puke, she knew I was lying. (Idk what it says about me that there's a more embarassing explantion than leaving puke bags lying around). She said she didn't get why I was lying or what was going on, so in the end I just told her the truth, I've got an eating disorder.\n\nShe was still disgusted by the bags, but also annoyed when she realised how much I've been hiding the issue, while we were planning to move in together and a lot of times over the years when I've cancelled plans and insisted everything's fine. She said I should have got help ages ago or just told her and she would have tried to help. She also said that she's always been open about her mental health issues to me and feels upset that I didn't have the same trust in her. This all ended with her saying that I either need to get help or move out. Which seems extreme to me, I get that the bags were gross but we haven't had any other issues living together and I fully intend for that to be a one time thing. I also just feel so ashamed about her knowing about my ED. I really do think it's been getting better, so having to talk to someone about it just seems like a waste of time and more embarassment.\n\nThis happened yesterday, I went for a walk and my flatmate and I haven't spoken since. I really wish this never happened but I want to fix the friendship. So, AITA?", "assistant": "INFO …. did you hide it well or do you THINK you hid it well? when i was the worst in my ED, i thought nobody knew. after recovery i realized how painfully obvious i was about everything. you deserve help. it might not be what you want to hear and it feels extreme, but she ultimately wants the best for you. im going to say NAH here but her guilting you for not saying anything about your ed feels a little shitty"}

During my summer break from college, I (18M) been working with my college roommate (19M) on the 2nd floor offices installing new computers and cables on the weekend. While the store is open on the weekends, the 2nd floor offices are empty.\n\nA couple of weeks ago we were working there until noon, when we decided to go for lunch. We had a big meal and both of us needed to use the bathroom urgently. We hurried up to the 2nd floor bathrooms and I told him that I really needed to go first, but if he was also in a hurry that he could go and pick up the keys for the women's bathroom from the reception and use it.\n\nWhile I’m doing my business, I hear the women's bathroom open. I shouted to my friend “You found the keys?” but didn’t get a reply. Next thing I know, I hear the toilet seat going down and the worst shitting/farting sounds ever. So, naturally I start shouting again to my friend stuff like “Holy F\\*ck… you shouldn’t have been eating that shit”, “You are dying inside”, “Get an exorcism immediately” and/or other stuff to that effect. My friend didn’t reply, I thought he was in a pretty bad shape, so I stopped and finished up my business.\n\nAs soon as I get out of the bathroom, I see my friend coming over with the keys for the women’s bathroom in his hand. He tells me that he just found them and that he needs to go. At this point I’m panicking and laughing at the same time as I don’t know WTF just happened. We hid in an empty office with the door slightly opened to see who came out of the bathroom.\n\nA minute later an employee (\\~40F) comes out of the women’s bathroom looking all scared, hurries to the lobby and goes downstairs. She didn’t see us, and we didn’t see her again for the rest of the day. My friend and I have a good laugh about the situation and keep working (after he finally goes to the bathroom).\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks later, my dad tells me that I cannot bring my friend anymore to help me with the work we were doing. He tells me that an employee complained that he was harassing and making lewd comments about her. While I didn’t tell him the story, I told him that it must be a mistake as I was sure that my friend had never interacted with anyone and that we kept 99.99% of our time on the 2nd floor. He told me that he understood, but he had no choice.\n\nThis employee didn’t really need to use the 2nd floor bathroom as there are bathrooms on the first floor. Also, while I get that I made unfortunate comments about her bodily functions, they were not lewd. At the end, we didn’t tell anybody about what happened, and she didn’t know that we saw her… so she just could have forgotten about the situation.\n\nI haven’t told my buddy yet, but I feel I’m screwing him as he needs the money/work. However, I think even if I come clean there is no guarantee we can continue working on that project.\n\nAITA for not telling the whole story and/or owning up for what I did?", "assistant": "YTA.

Eve is the one who wants the divorce. Adam very much does not, but Eve is determined and has already moved out. I (30F) can’t blame her, because I would have done the same.\n\nThe background is that my brother has ADHD and has never been very good at complying with treatment to help with it.  He’s one of those people that has an amazing bouncy personality to be friends with, but living with him is a complete nightmare.  I know, because growing up I was always expected to pick up his slack. He doesn’t like to take meds because he doesn’t like the way they feel and therapy has never seemed to help him much. He and Eve met in college and he was living with our parents up until they got married, so I don’t think she realized just how bad it was until then.  Eve is one of the most chill people I know, but I’ve watched her go from happy and put together to a nervous wreck over their marriage.  We’re friends and talk a lot and she confided in me that she feels like the only adult in the house and it’s driving her slowly insane more than once. They tried marriage counseling but no lasting change. Eve has been in therapy for herself for the last year, but my brother doesn’t see the point.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was her having surgery and my brother completely dropping the ball on helping her while she recovered as she couldn’t get around easily. Her mother ended up having to fly there to take care of her. She told him that she couldn’t do it anymore and she wanted to have kids, but could never trust him to be a good parent now, so they needed to split. Ever since she moved out, his life has been complete chaos because she really was the only one doing any of the household management.\n\nI’ve been holding my tongue and trying to be supportive while he cries and complains because I know it’s hard. But I was on the phone with him the other day and he called Eve a bitch for leaving him and making it about kids when she knows how much he wants them. I just had it. I told him that Eve leaving him was the best move for her own mental health and she was probably right that he’s not responsible enough to be a father right now and may never be at this rate. He needs to take a good look at his life without Eve and ask himself if he’s capable of doing the hard everyday parts of parenting or if he just wanted the fun parts while Eve did all the actual work?\n\nHe’s furious with me and our mom chewed me out for kicking him while he’s down.

My daughter is 16 years old, and the result of a tryst with an older woman when I was 20. This is not a brag, it's simply informative. It wasn't a random one-night stand, we weren't strangers, we had known each other for several months up until that point and continued talking for almost a year afterward. Just never told me. Also, it wasn't an affair. I don't know why she never told me.\n\nI met my daughter for the first time recently, and everything went well. We've been communicating almost daily via text. She's excited to get to know me, holds no resentment against me because she understands that I was never informed of her existence at all, and is excited to meet the paternal side of her extended family. All in all, everything went so much better than I was expecting. She's the spitting image of me, but we did a test just to be absolutely certain and the results proved that she is indeed my daughter 😁 We'll call her M. \n\nSo obviously, I announced this news to my family. My sister was the first one I told, because she has been my Confidant since we were in high school and we don't keep anything from each other. But with M's blessing, I have also informed other family. My oldest niece, the daughter of my sister, is excited because now all of a sudden she has an older girl cousin. Very big deal for a 10 year old.\n\n\nThe problem is my SIL (22F). We'll call her S. I'm not a rich guy, but as a bachelor I do alright for myself. I have a tendency to spoil my nieces and nephews with candy and sometimes toys when I visit. Well, my youngest niece, the daughter of my brother and S, recently had a birthday party. A lot of the extended family was there, including my own grandparents. Closer to the end of the party, S made a comment about how I didn't even know that M existed for 16 years and it shouldn't be such a big deal that she becomes part of my life now, because I was fine without her for so long and vice versa. She said she just doesn't understand why I'm making it such a big deal. Well, despite the fact that I'm generally very slow to anger and always have been, I unloaded on her. I said some things that I shouldn't have, that I now regret, and left the party. S has been texting me all week about how terrible I am for what I said. My brother is on her side because it's his wife, but my sister is on my side because I was provoked. Our parents haven't been involved, but S has obviously told hers because they've texted me as well.\n\nEdit: I said that she was being a selfish bitch and was too dense and blonde to understand why it's a big deal for me even if she doesn't think it is.\n\nEdit 2: some of y'all are real hung up on the blonde part.

Anyways this comment sparked a disagreement between us because I vented about his lack of assistance in helping to get her or any of her belongings ready to go in the morning. His solution after getting frustrated with me was to tell me I need to “make him a list of what I would like him to do for her” and I refused as I said I don’t want to mother him as well and as her parent he should know what needs to be done (diaper changes, outfit, teeth brushing, daycare bottles cleaned and filled up, etc.) I tried explaining that as her mom no one ever gives me a “list” I simply look around or think about what needs to be done.

She helped explain the mental load concept and I have to say ever since then things have improved SO much. Ever since he has really flipped the switch and helped me out a ton especially in the mornings. He really is a great guy with a big heart but sometimes a bit aloof to certain things hence why I even wanted to write this post so he could see I wasn’t alone in my perspective of his behaviors. Lastly for those wondering if I’m the “naggy/controlling woman” the answer is no lol I didn’t care what he made or what task he took off my list for the morning.

A few years ago, Tom cut ties with me, Sarah (31 F), and the rest of our friend group because his fiancée didn’t like any of us. At the time, it was really hurtful, but we all kind of moved on and let it go. We haven’t heard from him since.\n\nRecently, I found out that Tom is getting married, and it turns out that he uninvited Sarah from the wedding at the last minute—because his fiancée still doesn’t like her. This really hit home for me, as Sarah is married now and had invited Tom to her wedding a while back, and he actually attended. It just feels really unfair that Sarah is now being excluded, especially since Tom had no problem attending her wedding and was clearly willing to put aside his fiancée’s issues with her back then.\n\nTo make things even more frustrating, the invitations Tom sent out for his wedding were last minute to begin with. So, Sarah was originally invited, then uninvited because of his fiancée. It seems like Tom is once again choosing his fiancée over long-time friendships, and I can’t help but feel like he’s repeating the same behavior that caused him to lose contact with all of us in the first place.\n\nI’m really tempted to call Tom out on this. I feel like he needs to be held accountable for uninviting Sarah, and for the way he has treated his friends over the years because of his fiancée’s issues. But I’m also worried that reaching out after all this time will just cause drama, especially with the wedding approaching.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I confronted Tom about uninviting Sarah? Is it worth saying something, or should I just leave it alone and let him handle his own relationships?\n\nEdit: Answering some questions to add context: \n\nINFO: do you know why his fiancee dislikes Sarah so much? I’m assuming you and your other friends were still invited to his wedding, so this is weird.\n\nI think at one point the issue raised was that Sarah “acted too familiar” and “was hotter than me”.\n\nINFO: Your friendship seems already over.   What's your goal here?\n\nJust calling out what I feel is shitty behavior. But not scold or preach, just have a calm discussion of why this isn’t right, and even though I would want to bury the past and be friends with him, as he has asked, I fear nothing has changed and the cycle will repeat. \n\nInfo: what do you mean by \"confront?\"\n\nDo you mean get coffee with him and say something like \"it really hurt all our feelings when you cut us out.  I'd like to re-establish a friendship, but once bitten twice shy, and your uninviting Sarah makes me feel that not much has changed, and maybe it'd be better to just accept that we go our separate ways, rather than do round 2 of the same\" - and then listen to what he says, and have a respectful honest conversation?\n\nYes, that's perfectly fine.\n\nDo you mean \"start scolding him for not inviting Sarah, even though you don't know what's actually going on in the relationship?\"\n\nNot fine, and will just get you uninvited.\n\nOption 1. Option 2 is just not my style or way.\n\nINFO: Are you going to the wedding ?\n\nI never planned to but was feeling guilty, and now I don’t want to and don’t feel that bad about it. Just indifferent now. \n\n* **Update: 1 Day Later**\n\nThank you to everyone who commented with advice — it was really helpful, even though some of it was a bit harsh, it was much needed and gave me clarity. I wanted to provide an update on how things went.\n\nTom had expressed remorse in the past for distancing himself from the group, which is why I wanted to have a conversation with him. However, after a group call with the rest of our friends (minus Tom), we all agreed that while we didn’t agree with his decision to uninvite Sarah, it was ultimately his wedding and his choice. We decided it wasn’t really our place to comment on it. \n\nAs for the wedding, none of us are attending. The late invitation and uninvitation situation made it feel like we’d be walking into a situation where we might feel slighted, so we collectively decided to RSVP no. Since we had all already booked flights and hotels, we’re planning to reschedule our trips and have a mini reunion somewhere else instead. It'll be a chance to reconnect and have a more positive experience as a group.\n\nWhile I’m still a bit disappointed by how things played out, I think it was the right choice for us. Thanks again for all the thoughtful input — it really helped guide my decision-making process.", "assistant": "YTA - if he cut ties with you a few years ago, why is this even on your radar?

She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy.

I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys. \n\nGf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk.

Though my mother has supported me in many ways (she relocated from my home town to my college city), she gets frustrated if I do not perform to the high standard she expects of me. I was supposed to go back to on-campus housing last month as well, but since I was a bit unsure, we decided to wait a bit more. Unfortunately, this has caused a few issues. For one, my mom is getting more and more frustrated she can't go back to her life back home. And the fact that my grades are okay, maybe average makes her even more mad, because as I mentioned she expects too much from me. It was my birthday yesterday. So my brother (who is pursuing higher studies abroad) sent me a cake. Usually we cut the cake the previous day as per family tradition.

She also said that I was not grateful for what my parents did for me, and that I do not know how to do anything, I couldn't study, I couldnt stay alone.

This thing is nothing fancy, just a small device you fill with cleaning solution and attach disposable mop pads.\nLet me be clear, in the 4 years we have had this thing Chris has not ONCE paid for any replacement moping pads.

My wife's parents divorced when she was a teenager and both her mom and dad have since remarried.  There is a lot of competition between her mom, dad, and stepmom in terms of \"family time.\"  Everything has to be equal.  Meaning if we spend an afternoon with her mom, then we have to do the same thing with her dad and stepmom. Mom and stepmom especially put a lot of pressure on my wife and guilt trip her about it.  \n\nMy wife has a lot of trouble standing up for herself and saying \"no.\"  Before we had kids, this wasn't as big of a deal.  If we had to attend 2-3 different Thanksgivings or Xmas gatherings, not a huge deal. I mean, it sucked, but it wasn't the end of the world.  Now though, with 2 young kids, it's exhausting and I absolutely hate it.  \n\nMy wife and I have had numerous talks about her setting boundaries about this because I am at the end of my rope with it.  The bickering and pressure is constant and the need to keep everything \"equal\" essentially determines our entire non-work schedule.  \n\nWe had to attend 2 separate Easter events this Spring (we're not even religious) because we went to one with her mom, so we \"had\" to do one with her dad and stepmom.  After that, I told my wife I was done with this BS.  I told her that she needs to stand up to her parents and start setting boundaries and saying \"no.\"  I told her I won't allow her parents to continue to dictate how we live our lives.  I told her if she is incapable of doing this, then I will absolutely step in and tell them off.  \n\nBut she begged me not to do that because she doesn't want to ruffle feathers and promised she would do better.  Of course, that didn't happen.  We ended up having to run around to 3 separate places on Memorial weekend because of this same stuff.  After we got home from the last stop, I told my wife I am done with this and will now pick and choose which things I want to go to.  I won't stop her from going and I will stay home with one or both kids if she doesn't want to take them, but I'm done.\n\nLo and behold, this past weekend she was talking to her mom and 4th of July came up.  My FIL had already invited us to his house for a pool day and my wife told her mom about it.  So, of cours we have to do something with them that weekend as well.  When my wife told me about this, I told her that I will not be attending both and I will choose if I want to attend either.\n\nMy wife must have vented to her mom about this because a couple days later, I got a call from my wife's stepdad (the only sane person in this, really).  He told me that he completely agrees with me and that he's talked with his wife numerous times about not pressuring my wife, but she doesn't listen either.  \n\nHe suggested that whenever his wife pressures my wife into keeping things \"equal,\" that he and I go golfing together instead.

My wife is weird about butt stuff. I'm not talking about sexual butt stuff, that's obviously personal and up to the individual. I mean her unwillingness to acknowledge that anything comes out of butts or that people even have buttholes.\n\nWhen we bought our house, I wanted to install a bidet, but my wife was against it. I told her she doesn't have to use it but she said just seeing it would gross her out. I mentioned not feeling clean just from wiping with paper and she didn't understand. Not everyone has naturally hairless assholes that barely require wiping! She asked if I could find an alternative. I said I could use wet wipes, but they're not flushable (none of them are BTW) so they'd have to go in the trash. She didn't like the idea of poopy things in the trash can, and told me to figure something else out that she didn't have to know about.\n\nSo, onto my ass rag. I took an old towel, tore it up, and installed a discreet hook behind the toilet to hang the rag. It's completely hidden. The way our bathroom is set up (we only have one), the sink is right next to the toilet. So I'm able to wet the rag, clean up, wash it in the sink, and hang it back up. I swap it out a couple times a week. Gross? Maybe. But I figured that's my business since my wife did not want to hear about my butthole cleaning habits.\n\nRecently my wife and I were showering together and she forgot to bring in a washcloth for herself. I don't use one, I use a sisal pouch with bar soap. I offered to hop out and grab her a washcloth, but she said, \"No, don't worry about it, I'll just use yours!\" and reached for my ass rag. I said you don't want to use that. She asked why. I said just trust me. She kept pushing.\n\nSo I came clean about my ass rag. She was horrified, started dry-heaving, and kicked me out of the shower. Apparently she had been using it as a washcloth for years whenever she forgot hers, which is often. What I don't get is how she thought that was my washcloth because A) It's hidden behind the frikkin' toilet and B) She knows I don't use a washcloth. We got into an argument. From my perspective, it was obvious that my ass rag wasn't a washcloth, all bets are off when you use someone else's shit without asking, and her butthole hangup is interfering with my personal hygiene. From her perspective, I violated a clear boundary she set years ago and I'm just an overall gross person. I did apologize but I was upset and my apology wasn't really sincere.\n\nI'm sleeping on the couch right now to try and give her some space. But I'd like to know if I owe her a more sincere apology over this ass rag fiasco. I'm really not sure and her reaction has me thinking that maybe I actually am disgusting and I'm lacking the perspective to see it. But I also don't think her butthole aversion is normal, and it's the main reason I ended up resorting to the ass rag solution in the first place and not telling her about it.", "assistant": "NTA.

This is really apparent with holidays and the kids.\n\nShe always choses to go to her moms for holiday even if I do it on an early day or late day.

I hadn’t even meant to do it, but I didn’t know how to behave with the underlying anger that I now had. So, in the end I just asked him why he had done it, trying my best not to sound angry as I generally don’t like being angry. \n\nHe said he “wanted to get to know the people that raised me.” His answer was bulllshit for a lot of reasons, but the biggest one is that I have literally told him that my older sister is the person that raised me. When he met her and her husband, we all joked that it was like meeting-the-parents.\n\nI told him that he had every right to ‘want’ to meet whoever he wanted, but he had no right to go behind my back and force me to be around people I have cut out of my life.\n\nThe next thing he said is truly what made me break up with him. He said he “doesn’t understand how someone can stop talking to their family.” I cannot stress enough how many times I have explained to him why I have stopped talking to my parents. He has asked more than once. \n\nAfter he said that I think I had a realization. He doesn’t understand me, he has made no efforts to do so. So I told him that after I dropped him off at his place I didn’t want to see him anymore because I don’t want to put in effort with someone that doesn’t care about what I want. He didn’t take that well, but his emotions are not my problem anymore. \n\nRight now, I mostly feel really sad.

Not chores, mind you, and not things she might have done to earn her allowance previously, but actual jobs: the allowance (which I assume is not equivalent to an actual income) continues if she is actually looking for work, and otherwise doing things with her time that make the world a better place.  Join a park clean up.  Volunteer as a dog walker with the local pound or rescue. Work with a festival or local event group.\n\nIt's fairly important that her allowance not be an actual income here, since she's going to want actual money soon and she needs to understand that it comes from work.

This left my younger brother Tom (30M) and I, as the sole beneficiaries of their estate. \n\nI didn’t expect to be left with much, since my folks helped me out financially more than enough times while they were still alive. I honestly only wanted a couple of family trinkets and heirlooms to keep as a keepsake. But to my surprise, as my brother and I sats down with the attorney to discuss our father’s will, we discovered that I was left with the majority of the farm (about 3/4) while Tom was left with the rest. \n\nThe only reason I can fathom behind this decision is that unlike Tom I have 2 children (10M) and (7F), so maybe that’s why I was given the bigger share?

I told her in that case I’ll transfer only half of the land to Tom, so our children could have a 1/4 of the land at their disposal in the hypothetical scenario they get into farming one day. \n\nJules is now not speaking with me until I reconsider my decision, I need to hear some unbiased opinions to see if I’m in the wrong here.", "assistant": "NTA I may be way off but it sounds like your wife saw a load of money slip from her fingers and she's angry rather than seeing the situation for what it is.\n\nYou wanted nothing to do with the farm but your brother has been there his whole life taking care of it.

My sister rolled her eyes and called me a prick before walking off. My niece hasn't spoken to any of us since which I think is a bit pathetic. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA, when you're a guest you are considerate about noises at 6:30 am on a Sunday morning and for sure showers could wait.\n\n>I said she shouldn't have invited us if she didn't want any noise and that we aren't used to a house with thin walls or having to share a bathroom as we all have en suites at our house. \n\nThere is a spectrum between not inviting someone and being ok with someone taking over a house with stuff and taking 4 showers at 6:30 am on a Sunday morning, and the en suites thing is the most entitled thing I read today. You made a comment about her house being less fancy than yours when you were staying at her place to save up on a hotel? You really told her this, then wrote the sentence here, clicked send, without seeing an issue, or are you purposely enjoying showing off your entitlement and being above the rules of common sense?"}

Let’s call her Jenny (22F). We became quite close over time, and I consider her a really good friend of mine. She has a boyfriend, Aiden (21M). Aiden studies in another state, and Jenny visits him every other month. However, Aiden flew down last week to stay with us. This was his first time visiting her in a year. It was also my first time officially meeting him. \n\nFor background, Jenny is quite disorganized and barely takes care of herself. She’s not unhygienic or anything, but she will frequently wear the first thing she spots, barely bother doing her makeup except on special occasions and her room is often a mess with clothes and books strewn about. There’s nothing wrong with that, obviously, but it’s something we joke a lot about. To clarify, a lot of the times she cracks jokes at her own expense about how disorganized she is. I joke about it too sometimes, and she laughs. It’s never been something she’s offended by. \n\nHowever, the week before Aiden flew down, she cleared up her whole room. She also wore her prettier outfits and did her makeup the whole time he was here. It was kind of cute. So one day, Aiden was talking about how pretty and decorated her room is while we were all chatting in the living room. Jokingly, I added that it was all for his benefit, you should see the hurricane that passes through on a daily basis. Jenny didn’t seem to mind this bit, and just rolled her eyes and smiled. I added to it telling Aiden he should visit more often, because it brings out the best in her. Then I laughed saying that I got to see the real her, and he only saw the polished version. That he should see her, walking to college in a hoodie that she has worn a dozen times, with her hair matching the mess in her room. I didn’t even know she wore owned some of the outfits she was wearing with him here. Jenny didn’t respond to this, and I didn’t know it was a big deal until today.\n\nToday, Jenny suddenly claimed that I deliberately insulted her in front of her boyfriend, and that she wasn’t sure why that remark was necessary to make. She thinks I was trying to act “superior” to her, and implemented mean girl strategies. She accused me of telling her boyfriend things that I had no business telling him about, and that it was up to her to talk about the way she normally lives. I really did not do any of this with a malicious intention though, and I tried to tell her the same. She was adamant that I was trying to justify it instead of acknowledging my mistake and apologizing. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I didn’t do this to hurt her, but I don’t know if I’m still wrong for doing it unintentionally. Was it really a big deal? AITA?", "assistant": "YTA\n\nYou continually paid her out to her boyfriend to her detriment \n\nI’ve seen this happen with flatmates before- generally it was the flatmate flirting with the boyfriend, by mocking their girlfriends habits\n\nYes, you are an asshole\n\nI’m confused as to how you can’t see this clearly?"}

Friday I spend with my husband and most other days of the week he is at work when I am home so our house is pretty quiet. But on Mondays, because I have it all to myself, I have been working on creating a wooden bench out of reclaimed 2by4’s. I had my headphones in listening to music sanding paint off of the wood when neighbor popped open her window to yell at me for making too much noise. Now I do feel like a bit of an ass because I am a night owl, working late shifts and all. However if my neighbor was making a bunch of noise I would just ignore it or find a way to block it out. I do understand that for most people who work daytime hours midnight seems late but like seriously it’s at most one night a week and sanding is not even loud!\n\nIDK it’s not like I was blasting music for a bumping party and this was the first time she has said anything to me about it. But I would understand if people mention how late it was but AITA for woodworking at night or is she the asshole for complaining?", "assistant": "YTA - Most noise ordinances in residential areas typically restrict loud noises between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.\n\nYou might not realize how loud you're being since you're wearing headphones, but if your neighbor is complaining about it - maybe find a different time to do that particular part of the job."}

Michael has struggled a lot the past year as he was forced to quit baseball in the middle of the season due to grades (that weren't even his fault, the teacher screwed up), breaking up with his girlfriend, and had money stolen from him by his grandma who we're nc with (long story but she has a lot of problems). Now he's struggling and I am trying to get him a therapist so his mental health doesn't fall apart. Ainsley's had some rough times but she had it pretty good this year. I decided to take Michael out and buy him something to make up for what happened to him. He got a baseball jersey that cost around $250-$300 and he loves it. I'm just happy to make him happy.\n\nAinsley came to me and asked me if I'd buy her a makeup palette from a small business she saw on YouTube and when I saw it was almost $50 I told her no. She got upset and said that I bought Michael something that was 5x the price of what she wants and I said that she hasn't been going through a tough time like he has. She said how I always cater to him when he's going through a bad time but won't do the same for her, and brought up something that happened a few years ago as an \"example.\" I told her to go to her room and now she refuses to leave her room now. My husband called me an AH and agreed with her but Michael says I did nothing wrong. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA. I do not believe you have to parent kids equally. People are different and from time to time that means they have to be treated differently.  But the notion that BECAUSE Ainsley has been able to overcome her rough times better she should get less, I'm sorry, NOTHING, is absurd. Don't get into a situation where your kids are racing to bottom cause thats the only time you care if they are content."}

My friend Cassie (25F) is also pregnant, and about 7 weeks ahead of me. \n\nAt first it was awesome being pregnant together— we’d vent about things, talk about how excited we are, plan mommy-to-be dates, etc. But now her attitude has been rubbing me the wrong way and I can’t stand talking to her about it anymore. \n\nShe’s gone from occasional venting to texting me upwards of 5 times a day about every horrible symptom she has. What bothers me is that I also have a lot of the same irritating pregnancy symptoms, but when I try to sympathize she pulls the “oh just WAIT until you’re at _____ weeks!” card as if it’s some strange competition. \n\nSo I dropped the sympathy angle and decided to just send her positive messages instead. But she totally sidesteps my attempts at positivity or my suggestions and complains about something else. For example, if I suggested a medicine I took for heartburn she’d reply “no I’ll just throw it up.” If I tried to suggest that she take some time off work because she’s clearly unhappy, she’d reply “I can’t I don’t have enough sick days.” Which is fair, I guess, but it gets old very quick being shot down over and over. She ignores all my upbeat messages about staying strong and that she’s almost there and that she can do it and replies with “I’m miserable” instead. \n\nWhat pushed me over the edge is she also stopped asking me about my pregnancy completely. Never checks in with me, never asks about my baby, and when I try to share anything positive she hardly acknowledges it. I went from feeling like we were in this together to feeling like she is the only pregnant one. I finally snapped when she texted me about her swollen ankles for the 20th time and said that I’m already anxious enough with my own due date creeping up and that her negativity is ruining my own pregnancy. I told her that I’m not feeling great either, but I’m not sending her lists of ailments every morning and I suggested she start venting to her husband instead. \n\nI obviously hurt her feelings— she read it and hasn’t spoken to me since. I feel completely justified, but my husband said I shouldn’t have said anything, that she’s “clearly struggling more”, and that I should just basically treat her with pity because she’s so unhappy. I think she’s a total downer and I don’t need that energy weighing me down, but now I’m wondering if I’m being insensitive because she is so close to giving birth and clearly having more complications than I am. \n\nAITA?", "assistant": "NTA, this sounds like a real pain to deal with and you already have enough of those. \n\nVenting is the kind of thing that should be either brief or mutual, imho. Hers is all the time and all about her, which is not okay. \n\nAlso, mention to your husband that she isn’t actually “clearly struggling more” as you deal with all the same problems she does (as you mentioned up top) and you don’t have the bandwidth to play silent listening ear on top of that. \n\nIf she wants to have an actual conversation where you both are heard, she knows where to find you."}

And one thing I try to reinforce with them is that if mom or dad says \"no\" if they go to the other parent, the answer they will get is no. Which means if they ask my wife, and she says no, regardless of how I feel on the matter, I'm going to back her up. And I expect my wife to do the same. Well this morning we were getting ready to leave and 4 year old asked my wife if she could get out a game that always makes a mess. So my wife said no, immediately 4 turned to me and asked the same question. So I said, \"No, your mom told you no.\" Which upset my wife, and I don't quite understand why. AITA?", "assistant": "YTA. Whilst I understand what you are trying to do. You should be saying “The answer is no.”. Not “Your mum said no.”.\n\nThe former shows a united front and shows that you are both on the same page. The latter tells the kids their mum is the “bad guy” and it is ONLY her fault you said no. It’s about the way you are phrasing it to be her fault whether that is intentional or not."}

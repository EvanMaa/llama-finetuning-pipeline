I have always wondered, why can't you just use the same cleanser but dilute it with water? Most of the time the \"gentler\" cleaners just have lower concentrations of the active ingredients anyway.\n\nI know sometimes gentler cleansers also have added moisturizers, but I still feel like diluting the cleanser or using less cleanser should improve results. So why doesn't it?", "assistant": "Please don't ever dilute non-alcohol-based skin products with water unless you have a lot of cosmetic chemistry experience. When you add water to anything you buy in the store, you are also:  \n  \n1. reducing the effectiveness of the preservative in the product. Products we buy in the store are formulated with precisely the amount of preservative they need to survive the bacteria and mold that grow in a warm, humid environment like a bathroom. They've been tested in very extreme conditions to make sure. Diluting your cleanser reduces that required preservative and makes it ineffective.  \n2. adding whatever bacteria/molds live in your water and air to that now-vulnerable product. Even if you use distilled water, you're giving any of the spores or bacteria in your bathroom an open invitation to come party in the stuff you apply to your face and eye area. It's actually dangerous and can result in infections that could affect your eyesight.  \n3. changing the distribution of the cleanser in the product. The products we buy in the store go through an industrial-quality mixing process. We can't replicate those kinds of mixing at home, and so when you dilute, some parts of your cleanser will still be harsher than other parts,\n\nYou can absolutely use \\*less\\* of a cleanser to see if that works, but most people find that it doesn't. Our skin products are the result of years of chemistry formulation and testing to see how different ingredients interact at different percentages. It's not only how much of an active ingredient that changes how gentle or harsh something is to your skin. It's how everything in the product interacts.\n\nHTH!"}

There are several factors you need for a tornado to happen. You need a large mass of cold air high in the atmosphere that is quickly moving in one direction with a thunderstorm present. Then need another large mass of warm air moving in the opposite direction. These two large bodies of air start a horizontal convection current with the warm air rising and the cooler air falling, and the wind from each blowing that rising/falling air back in the other direction. This horizontal convection current will sometimes get twisted as one side starts to sink towards the ground, and can then lead to a tornado forming. \n\nThis happens in the Midwest and Southeast because of the prevailing wind patterns of the US. The jet stream will primarily be blowing air from west to east across much of the US. Just south of the US though, the primary air currents blow from east to west. This also happens to be over the Gulf of Mexico which makes that air warm and moist. The regions where tornados occur happen to be where these two patterns can meet. \n\nIn areas like Colorado and Utah, yeah, it’s easy to get the cool air way up high blowing from west to east. But the warm moist air from the Gulf won’t typically make it that far north and west. That said “won’t typically” doesn’t mean never, and nature likes to show us if there’s a chance, it *will* happen sometimes."}

You could lose weight with 80% of your diet coming from fat. You'd feel terrible and probably not look very good, but it's possible. Weight loss is a question of calories, and the 3 macronutrients (fat, carbs, protein) all add up to make up your daily caloric intake. \n\nDifferent ratios can make it easier to lose weight.

No one is sure what causes them, but temperature and nutrient levels have been ruled out.\n\nPlant breeders, who consider this anomaly undesirable, keep an eye out for it when selecting for new cultivars, because the trait is inheritable.\n  \n*More Details*\n  \nDuring the normal development of bell peppers, seeds develop from fertilized structures or ovules. There are a multitude of ovules within the pepper which turn into tiny seeds that we discard before eating the fruit. When a pepper ovule gets a wild hair, it develops an internal proliferation, or carpelloid formation, which more resembles the parent pepper rather than a seed. \n  \nNormally, fruit forms if ovules have been fertilized and are developing into seeds. On occasion, a process called parthenocarpy occurs wherein the fruit forms with an absence of seeds. \n   \nThere is some evidence that suggests there is a correlation between the parasitic pepper inside a pepper. Internal proliferations most often develop in the absence of fertilization when the carpelloid structure mimics the role of seeds resulting in parthenocarpic pepper growth. \n  \nParthenocarpy is already responsible for seedless oranges and the lack of large, unpleasant seeds in bananas. Understanding its role in engendering parasitic peppers may end up creating seedless pepper varieties.\n  \n Whatever the exact cause, commercial growers consider this an undesirable trait and tend to select newer cultivars for cultivation. The pepper baby, or parasitic twin, is perfectly edible, however, so it’s almost like getting more bang for your buck. I suggest just eating the little pepper inside a pepper and continue to marvel at the strange mysteries of nature.\n  \n_____________________________________________________\n  \n[Source 1](http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Gardening/diggin-it/2010/0401/Have-you-ever-found-a-pepper-inside-a-pepper)\n  \n[Source 2](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/pepper/little-pepper-inside-pepper.htm)"}

So the inhibitor floods in so the transmitters stop making things, it wasn't just a simple shoot and forget model.\n\nThat's a way too simplified version but the point is that we had the model wrong for a long time.

Most of you will just say “because the lender is carrying more risk!!”.\n\nBut what I don’t get is how offering a higher interest rate actually offsets the risk of lending to someone with a lower credit score or lower salary. If someone wants to use their money irresponsibly and not pay off their loan, they are going to do that regardless of the interest rate they have. Also - it prevents them from investing their money because they spend so much on interest.", "assistant": "Because the bank can’t tell exactly which people will default. If they could they wouldn’t need credit scores and everyone would either get the same interest rate or get no loan at all. \n\nIf you have a lower score/lower income you’re more *likely* to default. They pool the high risk borrowers in one pool and charge them higher interest, knowing that more of them will default than the low risk pool. Because they’re *all* paying higher interest, the extra payments make up for more defaults. If the bank played it right, they get basically the same return from both groups."}

Nuclear waste/disasters contaminate areas for thousands of years and cause cancer. Why is that “clean”?", "assistant": "1. Usually when people are using the word clean in the context of energy production, they are talking about the impact on climate change. Nuclear produce very little greenhouse gases, which make it clean.\n2. People fear what they don't know so for most people nuclear radiation or nuclear waste is like a big dangerous thing. The truth is that most things we do produce dangerous (often radioactive) waste. With nuclear, the waste are concentrated in very little mass, yes it seem dangerous but it's far easier to control and secure. Compare that to particle and gases that are released in the air, which causes millions of death per year from respiratory disease. The death are a lot more direct with nuclear, but there is far less of them.\n\nIf you look at the number of death caused by each type of energy. Nuclear kill less than one person per terawatt hour of energy produced, Natural gas kill 2-4 people and Coal kill 20-100 people. (The variation depend on the study and what they include).\n\nNuclear might seem scary, but it create a lot less problem than most other source of energy.\n\n3) When you talk about contamination it's a bit more complex than that. Radiation is everywhere around us. It's in the soil you walk on, it's in the food you eat, it's in the air you breath. Radiation isn't an on (bad) and off (good) switch. It's a gradient that fluctuate with everything you do and everywhere you go. What is important is how much radiation people are exposed.\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRL7o2kPqw0) is a video talking about radioactivity around us."}

The logistics of building a skyscraper in downtown Manhattan were a nightmare. \n\nMost people wonder why One WTC took until 2009 to rise above street level - that answer is a little more complicated. The construction was plagued by budget overruns, planning deficiencies, red tape, and the 2008 financial crisis.

Is one of these options significantly more advantageous/healthy than the other?\n\nEdit: Wow this really blew up! This is my first big post on Reddit :) Thanks guys!", "assistant": "I don't think anyone has given you a real answer to your question, so here it goes: We all need sleep, some more than others (this is typically broken down by age). If you fell asleep for one minute 60 separate times, your body wouldn't gain the same value as if you slept for a straight hour. This happens because there are different physiological responses to the chemicals released by your body and brain when you sleep for a certain amount of time. \n\nThere are four levels of sleep depending upon the length and quality. Deep sleep, which almost always happens if you sleep for 2+ hours is what enables a full REM cycle, and is healthiest for you with more of \"long-term benefits\". The other standard is D2, which can occur as early as 20 minutes. This is why the power nap is effective. While you do not get a full REM cycle, your body and brain feel rejuvenated after D2 sleep.\n\nTo directly answer your question, the most effective way to sleep is to maximize REM cycles. If you break your sleep into shorter segments, the chances of completing REM cycles is smaller, but still possible. In this case power naps can get you through the day, but you may not be as healthy long term as someone consistently getting deep sleep."}

Dividing cells are primed for cancer because:\n1) a lot of the machinery needed to divide rapidly is already present in the cell so not a lot extra is needed to make it grow uncontrollably into a tumor/cancer\n2) the more a cell divides the more chances it has to make errors. DNA replication isn't perfect, and over time these errors can accumulate into dangerous mutations (this is also why cancer is more common in the elderly)\nThis is why we see a lot of cancer in tissues with a high \"cellular turnover\" rate - skin, liver, colon, etc. Cells that never divide (muscle fibers, neurons) almost never get cancer.

Once upon a time, you had to write all of your programs in a machine-specific variant of Assembly language. The code I wrote for a PDP-11 wouldn't run on a different type of computer. Worse, Assembly languages generally required a very thorough knowledge of the specific CPU architecture.\n\nThat's inconvenient. There were a number of \"high level languages\" out there- COBOL, Fortran, LISP, and while they might be fine for day to day work, they were terrible choices for what we call \"systems programming\"- doing something like writing an operating system, or interfacing directly with a piece of hardware. But they were *portable* (a COBOL program could run on any computer that had a COBOL compiler), and they were much easier to program.\n\nWhat was needed was a high level language that could easily be translated into Assembly (and machine code), but wasn't as abstract or distant from the hardware as languages like COBOL. Something that was basically \"user friendly Assembly\", that had the benefits of portability. That language was C.\n\nC was used to write Unix, and quickly became on of the dominant languages for writing software. It was fast, it was powerful, and it was *everywhere*. Its syntax became what programming is. Even languages that have no relationship to C at all, like JavaScript, use a similar syntax. So when programming philosophies began to change, and ideas like \"Object-Oriented Programming\" rose to ascendance, people took the approach of grafting these new concepts onto a C-like syntax.\n\nEnter C++ and Objective-C. Both of these languages introduce a new high-level abstraction: the *object*. They encourage you to write your programs as models of real-world systems. If you're managing a bank, you'll have an actual *object* in code called \"BankAccount\", and it has both behavior (things it can do) and attributes (data).\n\nThat's the key difference between these languages and plain-old C (although how they handle memory is also an important difference). As far as the difference between C++ and Obj-C, that difference is how they *designed* their object-oriented concepts. Obj-C lifted all of its features from a different language called Smalltalk. Essentially, Obj-C is what happens when Smalltalk and C have a baby (and, while there are some interesting features in it, let's be honest: it's an *ugly* baby). The goal of Obj-C was to retain all the best parts of both, and it partially succeeded.\n\nC++, on the other hand, took an approach to managing objects that was closer to C-style syntax. Of the two, C++ became the dominant choice- it had speed *similar* to C, but objects were a useful abstraction.\n\nPhew. Okay, finally, that brings us to C#, and to understand C#, we have to understand Java. Back in the 1990s, we were dealing with portability again. While a C program can be ported between computer architectures more easily than Assembly, it's not *instant*. You often have to customize the code, and even if you don't, you have to compile that code for each architecture. So the folks behind Java had a bright idea: what if we ran all our programs in a virtual machine- a \"in memory\" computer that we simulate? The idea was that they could port *Java itself* to different architectures, and then programmers could write a Java program that would run *any place Java worked*, without having to ever modify their program or compile it for different architectures. Java lifted most of its syntax from C++ with heavy modifications.\n\nFast forward to the early 2000s. Microsoft has been releasing its own Galapagos-mutant version of C++ for ages now, and it also has this ugly bastard language called Visual Basic, which is weirdly popular but… just terrible. They've been watching what's happening in the Java space, and decide, \"Goddamn, I want some of that action.\" So using the concepts of Java as a starting point, they create .Net. .Net, like Java, has a concept similar to a virtual machine. C# is a language that lifts features from Java and C++ (and a number of others) and creates code that can run on the .NET Common Language Runtime."}

The gas can’t just un-dissolve whenever it wants, though. It has to have the right conditions. One such condition is something called a “nucleation point” — basically, little microscopic rough patches on whatever the soda is touching. Most cups have lots of nucleation points all over, so the soda fizzes a lot from everywhere in the cup. Your monster cans, on the other hand, are very smooth on the inside, so there are basically zero nucleation points, so the soda can’t make bubbles and fizz.\n\nCouple cool things with nucleation points:\n1) champagne glasses are designed to only have one nucleation point, so you can see the bubbles all coming from a single spot.\n2) the classic Coke + Mentos experiment happens because Mentos are even more rough than a cup, so lots of bubbles form really really fast and create the classic foamy burst as they all try to rise to the top at the same time."}

Imagine a car going down a road approaching a roundabout, on neutral; it can follow the roundabout 180 degrees and start going in the reverse direction while only losing a little speed/energy.  But the car did a lot of \"work\" in the physics sense -- a multi-thousand-pound vehicle completely reversed direction in a few seconds.

A car going the same speed in the opposite direction still has the same kinetic energy. \n\nIf you're looking for where the momentum went, there's a force exerted on the road by the tires to keep the car going in a circle. The force on the car is toward the center of the circle, like the orbit of a moon or when you swing a mass on a string.

Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: What Is Supergravity And How Does It Work?\n\nBonus if someone could explain \"High Dimensional Supergravity\" which I stumbled on by accident. Thanks in advance for any help!", "assistant": "Back in the 50s there was a weird problem in physics about protons. Best theories at the time said they shouldn't have any internal structure - they should just be dots. But experiments said they did.\n\nOne of the suggestions for how to fix this was that maybe particles like protons were actually these tiny, infinitely thin strings, that vibrated across higher dimensions we couldn't see (beyond our normal 4; one time-dimension and three space-dimensions).\n\nThis turned out to be wrong - we now know protons are made up of quarks, but the idea of these infinitely thin strings vibrating across higher dimensions was interesting.\n\nA bit later (in the 70s) when people were struggling to make gravity work with quantum mechanics this string idea came back - it didn't work out for explaining protons, but it might explain gravity. And we started to get modern String Theory. String theories led to variants like Superstring theories (with 10 dimensions in total), and eventually a concept called Supersymmetry - suggesting that there were a bunch of symmetries in fundamental physics; things looked like other things. Supersymmetry was kind of promising because while regular String Theory was getting nowhere (and still hasn't) Supersymmetry tied in a bit better with the Standard Model (the non-String Theory approach to modern physics - which has been hugely successful). Sadly Supersymmetry also hasn't gone far - all the experiments to test it have produced null results.\n\nAnyway. When you take Supersymmetry theories and combine them with General Relativity (our current best model for gravity) you get Supergravity theories. This kicked off back in the 70s - as with String Theories in general, lots of exciting and award-winning maths was done to see how these symmetries would work.\n\nRemember how I said that String Theories involved things being these weird infinitely-thin strings vibrating in higher dimensions (beyond our usual 4 of spacetime)? That happens with supergravity. You need some extra dimensions for supergravity to work in.\n\nHigher-dimensional supergravity theories are theories that combine supersymmetry, with its higher dimensions, and general relativity, to get some new model for gravity. As I understand it they vary from 9-dimensional up to 12-dimensional supergravity theories (I think the 12-dimensional one has to add in an extra time dimension to make it work - beyond the classic 11-dimensions of M-Theory - the current best version of String Theory).\n\nAnyway.\n\nAs with all String Theory the maths is really exciting - you get all sorts of fun symmetries and patterns across the different things and through these extra dimensions. But experimentally it has gone nowhere. Supergravity was first developed in the 70s. It made a come-back in the 90s with a breakthrough in the maths (but not the physics) of String Theory. But nothing has really turned up, with no major progress since the early 00s.\n\nString theories - including supergravity - could be true. But at the moment we have no evidence to suggest that they are.\n\n-----------------\n\nSadly, like with most advanced physics, you need to know a whole load of maths to even begin to understand supergravity. It isn't really ELI5able."}
{"system": "You are a typical Reddit user from r/explainlikeimfive. Respond casually in subreddit style.", "user": "ELI5: How did starting a world war and systematically killing Jews in Germany intersect with Hitler's goal?\n\nWhat did Hitler want?", "assistant": "Obviously the below is a simplication of some very complex things. For those interested, I'm drawing a lot on Adam Tooze's *Wages of Destruction*, about the German economy under the Nazis, which will give a bit of an economic slant to this explanation.\n\nTo start off: the war.\n\nThe Nazis’ view of the world was that it was all about strength and about conflict between nations/races. Germany was facing competitors in the form of the British Empire, the French Empire, the Soviet Union and the United States. To compete with them it needed an empire of its own (or vast resources of land whose inhabitants could be ‘got rid of’, like the US).\n\nThis empire would provide resources for German industry, markets to sell German goods and land for agriculture. German farmers would no longer be limited to what the Nazis viewed as small plots of land. Germany could outshine the declining Empires of Europe and compete with the rising United States.\n\nNazism also celebrated violence and war, meaning it didn't shy away from them like others might. Not only were they a perfectly acceptable means to an end, then could be good in themselves, allowing the strong to flourish, to display masculine values, etc.. A victorious war would also help wipe out the shame of losing World War 1.\n\nWhere did the Nazis look for this empire? Unlike older German imperialists the Nazis looked to Eastern Europe. It wasn’t claimed by other Western European powers like so much of Africa and Asia. It was mostly part of the Soviet Union, but nobody else would be unhappy about the Communists losing territory. \n\nWhat about the people living there? Well there were some German-speakers who could be absorbed into a greater Germany, but most of the population was viewed as Slavic and an inferior race. So their interests could be ignored. They could be treated as second-class subjects like Indians in the British Empire or driven out/killed like American Indians in the US.\n\nSo how does this lead to a world war? Well expansion eastward meant an invasion of Poland. Britain and France had committed to defend Poland. The Nazis certainly hoped they wouldn’t honour this commitment, but they did. Germany was now in a with Britain and France (and their empires). Germany’s ally Italy also entered the war, while the United States gave considerable support to Britain.\n\nHowever this wasn’t *really* achieving the Nazis’ goals. After the stabilisation of the war in Western Europe These led to the invasion of the USSR in 1941. That had both a military goal – to remove the threat of the Soviet Union in the East – but perhaps more importantly it would provide that empire by conquering Ukraine, Belorussia, etc.\n\nUltimately Japan would also attack the US and British Empire in the Pacific, largely for its own ends, leading to its ally Germany declaring war on the US. \n\nThat’s a very brief summary of how Nazi objectives led to a world war.\n\nNow, what about Nazi attitudes and policy towards Jewish people? Well here we get into the nasty world of antisemitism. Broadly speaking, the Nazis believed that Jewish people – the Jewish “race” – were bad, weak, dangerous, corrupting, responsible for Germany’s surrender in World War 1, conspiring against Germany, running both international finance *and* international Communism. Obviously none of this was actually true. The question “why do Jews get blamed for everything?” is a bit much to get into here. I’ll only note a couple of things. First, that antisemitism, racism and ideas of “racial purity” were certainly not unique to Germany. Second, Jews were a useful scapegoat, an enemy to blame for Germany’s problems and to target people’s anger at.\n\nSo, what to do about Germany’s Jewish population? (And the Jewish population of conquered territories.) Before the war, the Nazis stripped Jewish people of rights, physically attacked them, stole property from them… They tried to push Jewish people out of Germany (hindered by the facts that other countries were often reluctant to take them and that they took much needed foreign currency with them). They mooted ideas like transporting Germany’s Jews to Madagascar or getting US financiers to pay for their emigration (which of course they would, since Jews controlled finance!).\n\nThere were some economic advantages to the policies of imprisoning and later killing Jewish people. Their property and wealth could be taken by the German state, which was not an insignificant contribution to German finances. And people in concentration camps could be used as slave labour, which was integral to the German war economy. \n\nBut ultimately the motivation for all this was a terrible racial ideology, the view that Jews were “vermin” and had to be driven out or, when that proved impossible, exterminated."}

They take out massive mortgages, business loans, invest with borrowed money, use credit lines and somehow it’s considered smart financial strategy? I remember winning a little chunk of cash a while ago on jackpot city which was enough to clear my credit card balance which I thought that was the smartest thing to do with it, but a friend of mine who works in finance told me he would've done the opposite like he would've kept the card, paid it down slowly and used the money to generate more income. That really made me think like why shouldn't we do it as well?

Possibly, they picked it up before they were even human.  The lice only become human-specific after they've been infesting humans long enough, after all. Parasite and host have a close evolutionary history, and evolve to impact one another. In the wild, animals are rarely totally patasite-free. I highly recommend reading up on parasitology and the impact of parasites on the ecosystem, it's really fascinating. Many (if not most) predators would go hungry if not for parasites influencing their hosts so they can move on to the next stage of their life cycle!"}

If you go north, you dont go east at all, and vice versa, so we call these orthogonal. I can then write a distance traveled as some parts north and some parts east without them influencing each other, for instance 1 mile north, 2 miles east.\n\nYou can think of a superposition initially as just like traveling in two different directions, ala north and east. The part where this gets weird is that in quantum mechanics, we aren't talking about distances, but things called \"probability amplitudes.\" So you might be in a state .71 spin up and .71 spin down. These probability amplitudes correspond to the (square root of the) chance of getting a measurement outcome. This example we would have even odds of measuring up or down.\n\nThis becomes more than just probabilities when you start looking at how things evolve and interact. A tricky little example is to evenly combine something that is in the \".71 spin up and .71 spin down\" state with something in the \".71 spin up and -.71 spin down\" state. Just like combining two distances, we add the amplitudes together (with a little bit of math to keep things normalized) and we find that we have something entirely in the spin up state after this combination. Therefore combining two things that have a 50:50 chance of being spin up or spin down on measurement gave us something with a 100% chance of being spin up.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, I love trying to break down quantum stuff for the public :)"}

In this orbit, the satellite would remain directly over the same point on earth all the time.  And this orbit can only exist directly over the equator.\n\nThe tether, therefore, would also need to be attached at the equator, for two reasons:\n\n\\- it's the shortest distance to the satellite\n\n\\- if it's not on the equator and is, say, 100km North then the tether would be exerting a small sideways force on the satellite, trying to pull it out of the orbit a small bit.  If the satellite were to be pulled out of the geostationary orbit then it would enter a geosynchronous orbit -- it's still over the same line of longitude, but from a viewpoint on earth would move slightly north and south in the sky.  The tether isn't going to let it move south and remain at the same altitude, so it would then start to get out of sync with it's own orbit.  This wouldn't be good.\n\nIn short, if the tether was not on (or very close to) the equator then the satellite's orbit could become somewhat chaotic.\n\nHaving some boosters on the satellite would help, but only for so long.  Satellites in geostationary orbit still need to use boosters on occasion in order to fix their orbit if they start to wander.  But having to over fix it because of the tether would use up more fuel.\n\nNotwithstanding, the \"satellite\" here would be something massive anyway, like an asteroid -- nothing man made.  Also, in order to keep it in balance there would need to be something on the other side stretching out into space, with the same mass as the tether.  But these are just nitty-gritty details..."}

The problem is, the United States, and indeed most of the world, has had practically free trade since the 50s. What these new treaties do is allow corporations to manipulate currency and stock markets, to trade goods for capital, resulting in money moving out of an economy never to return, and override the governments of nations that they operate in because they don't like policy. \n\nFor example, Australia currently has a similar treaty with Hong Kong. They recently passed a \"plain packaging\" law for cigarettes, they cannot advertise to children anymore. The cigarette companies don't like this, so they went to a court in Hong Kong, and they *sued Australia* for breaking international law by making their advertising tactics illegal. This treaty has caused Australia to give up their sovereignty to mega-corporations. \n\nAnother thing these treaties do is allow companies to relocate whenever they like. This means that, when taxes are going to be raised, corporations can just get up and leave, which means less jobs, and even less revenue for the government. \n\nThe TPP has some particularly egregious clauses concerning intellectual property. It requires that signatory companies grant patents on things like living things that should not be patentable, and not deny patents based on evidence that the invention is not new or revolutionary. In other words, if the TPP was in force eight years ago, Apple would have gotten the patent they requested on rectangles."}

Steel cut are close to how people original ate oats, they are coarsely chopped with steel blades. They retain more of the original oat flavor but also take longer to cook. Rolled oats are steamed and then pressed through rollers flattening them. Since they've been essentially par-cooked it only take 5 minutes or so to cook them at home, but the steaming and rolling process means they lose a lot of the original flavor. Then quick oats are rolled oats that go through further processing to cut down on cooking time further so you could pour hot water over them and wait a minute and they're done.\n\nEdit: wow I didn't expect one of my most popular posts on Reddit to be a response about processing oats...thank you fellow nerds for your interest in the esoteric and minutae subjects of the world.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people asking the same question \"does it need to be cut by steel blades? What if it's cut with a different metal?\" The answer is no. The steel cut is just a reference to the process. In this case the word \"steel\" is another word for \"blade\" or \"knife\".

Normally, nuclear fusion—where atoms smash together and release a ton of energy—needs super high temperatures, like in the middle of the sun. But cold fusion asks, “What if we could do it at room temperature, right here in a lab?” Sounds awesome, right?\n\n\n\nScientists thought it might be possible because, on paper and in math formulas, it doesn’t break any laws of physics. The idea was that if you put hydrogen inside certain metals, like palladium, the atoms would get squished together so tightly that they could fuse without needing crazy heat. In theory, it seemed like it could work.\n\n\n\nBack in 1989, two scientists, Fleischmann and Pons, said they had done it, but the problem was no one else could repeat their results.

Osteoclasts, on the other hand, dissolve and break down (resorb) old or damaged bone cells, making room for osteoblasts to create new tissue in areas that are growing or in need of repair.

Then it slows until our late twenties, when we usually reach peak bone mass. After this, bone density tends to plateau for a time before, generally after age 50, bone breakdown starts to exceed bone formation, gradually decreasing bone density as we age.\n\nhttps://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/gpcrs-bone-formation-osteoporosis/\n\n————————————————————————————————————", "assistant": "They found a gene that correlates extremely strongly with how strong a body's bones are.

They then ran tests with a new drug that works to trigger the gene, and it appeared to work well in their study of lab mice.\n\nEssentially, bones stop developing properly due to age and other factors, and until now our treatment has essentially been patching up the problem as it arises (both literally and figuratively).
